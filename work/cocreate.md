## Background

Co-Create are a leadership training and coaching consultancy with clients that include Unicef, The Trainline, Mercedes-Benz and the Bank of England. They needed a new brochure site to advertise their services and promote their case studies.

## Solution

This was a pure development task as the designs had already been commissioned. I built the site with Wordpress, using the Genesis base theme and custom-made  Gutenberg blocks.
