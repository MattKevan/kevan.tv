Attend is the membership body for volunteering organisations in hospitals and other healthcare settings, with over 29,000 volunteers across the UK.

Between 2004 and 2011, I led the organisation's creative team, a mix of staff and volunteers, to manage the organisation's brand, produce publications and maintain the website.

I was responsible for writing, editing and designing Attend's supporter magazines, annual reviews and information leaflets, as well as editing videos, organising events, including the organisation's diamond jubilee, and even designing the interiors of hospital shops.

I also led a project that helped designers who had suffered brain injuries gain experience and return to work by providing design services to Attend's member charities, acting as an in-house design agency.
