The Dove & The Seagull is an Etsy store I run, offering high-quality reproductions of vintage prints, posters and botanical art. I source and re-touch public domain artwork, including works by Karl Blossfeld, Kandinsky, Anna Atkins, Hilma af Klint, Paul Nash, Works Progress Administration and more.
