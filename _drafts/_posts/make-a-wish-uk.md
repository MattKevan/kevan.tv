### Background

Make-A-Wish UK grant magical wishes to enrich the lives of children and young people fighting life-threatening conditions.

Make-A-Wish wanted to modernise their site design, making it fully mobile resoponsive, and to increase donations, boost social engagement and increase the visibility of their fundraising events.

### Content strategy

Make-A-Wish had identified that a large proportion of their supporters donate on the spur of the moment, in response to an emotional story. 

They already had a large number of stories of granted wishes. To maximise their effectiveness I brought them front and centre in the new site structure and added strong calls to make a donation or share on each.

It quickly became apparent that their wish stories - present on their previous site but hidden away - were incredibly powerful and should be given much more prominence on the site for just this reason. In addition I added strong calls to action on every story to either make a donation or share on social media.
