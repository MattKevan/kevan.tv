- title: The Design of Everyday Things, revised and expanded edition
  author: Donald A. Norman
  description: Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we try to figure out the
    shower control in a hotel or attempt to navigate an unfamiliar television set
    or stove. When The Design of Everyday Things was published in 1988, cognitive
    scientist Don Norman provocatively proposed that the fault lies not in ourselves,
    but in design that ignores the needs and psychology of people.

  author: Susan Weinschenk
  description: 'We design to elicit responses from people. We want them to buy something,
    read more, or take action of some kind. Designing without understanding what makes
    people act the way they do is like exploring a new city without a map: results
    will be haphazard, confusing, and inefficient. This book combines real science
    and research with practical examples to deliver a guide every designer needs.'
