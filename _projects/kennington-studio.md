I've long been interested in photography and producing prints of my photographs. The cyanotype holds a facscinating balance between painterly abstraction and photographic realism.

### About cyanotypes

Invented by Sir John Herschel in 1842 as a method of reproducing notes and diagrams, the cyanotype process wasn't used for photography until the following year when Anna Atkins, the first female photographer, released the first book illustrated with photographs.

Cyanotypes are created by painting the paper with a solution of Potassium Ferricyanide and Ammonium Iron III Citrate. The negative is applied and the paper is exposed under an ultraviolet lamp. Once exposed, the paper is washed and allowed to dry for 24 hours where the finished print takes on the characteristic deep blue colour.
