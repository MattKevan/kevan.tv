[Cyanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanography) is one of the earliest photographic print processes, invented in 1842 by Sir John Herschel. It was used later that year by [Anna Atkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Atkins) to create the first photographic book.

Commonly used to reproduce drawings and plans – hence the term 'blueprint' - the cyanographic process can also be used to create expressive and unexpected images due to its low resolution and lack of tonal control. 

I created these images from photographs I'd taken by painting the light-sensitive emulsion on watercolour paper, applying a full-size acetate negative and exposing with ultraviolet light. After washing and drying, these were the results.
