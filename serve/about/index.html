			<h1 class="title">About</h1>

			<p class="lead">As a designer, I'm fascinated by what makes things work, and how best to communicate ideas.</p>
			<p>For the last four years I’ve been working as creative manager and UX lead for NDP, a busy Drupal-focused web agency based in the heart of London.</p>

<p>At NDP I’m responsible for the studio’s creative output, managing the creative team and working closely with the rest of the studio, including consultants, project managers and developers.</p>

<p>Although I now focus on UX design and leading our team of creatives,  I still enjoy getting involved at different stages of the process, from pitching to new clients, helping existing clients define their strategy, conducting user research, running workshops, producing personas, wireframes, content audits, prototypes, UML, finished designs and more. I’m also an experienced site builder and front-end developer – I’ve been building sites with Drupal and Wordpress for over eight years – so I also build sites myself too when time allows. </p>

<p>Before working for NDP, I was creative manager at Attend, a national healthcare membership organisation that supports 800 healthcare charities in the UK. There, I managed a team of staff and volunteers, wrote and designed their print publications, including magazines, annual reviews, learning materials, designed and built their website and CRM database – and designed the interiors of hospital shops across the UK.</p>

<p>In my spare time I work on various side projects, including <a href="http://www.illustrators.co" target="_blank">Illustrators.co</a>, a curated marketplace for illustrators to sell their work directly to the public. </p>

<p>I’m fascinated by what makes things work. I love the challenge of understanding a problem and discovering new ways to solve it, to make it function better, faster or more efficiently – whether it’s a print publication, a website, a process or an organisation. </p>

<p>I live in central London with my wife and cat.</p>

<p>To get in touch send me an email at hello@kevan.tv – I’d love to hear from you.</p>
