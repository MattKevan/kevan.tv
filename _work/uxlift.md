I launched UX Lift in 2017 as a way to organise the huge collection of UX and design links I'd built over the years.

As the site came together, I realised it could be useful to both to new and experienced designers. While there's a lot of good resources out there, I hadn’t found anywhere that attempted to collect everything together in one place.

The site now contains many hundreds of links to articles, tools, books, resources, courses, publications and much more and I'm adding to it constantly.

### Newsletter

In 2020 I launched a twice-monthly newsletter, consisting of articles, tools, resources and more that I've found useful or discovered since the last edition. However, I have a particular interest in design ethics, innovation, accessibility and leadership. 

I’m also fascinated by the cutting edge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, so there's a lot of links to strange/wonderful/scary AI projects.
