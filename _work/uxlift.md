I launched UX Lift as a way to organise the huge collection of UX and design links I'd built over the years.

As the site came together, I realised it could be useful to both to new and experienced designers. While there's a lot of good resources out there, I hadn’t found anywhere that attempted to collect everything together in one place.

The site now contains many hundreds of links to articles, tools, books, resources, courses, publications and much more and I'm adding to it constantly.

### Newsletter

In 2020 I launched a twice-monthly [newsletter](https://uxlift.substack.com) consisting of the latest UX & design trends, articles, tools, resources and more, with a particular focus on design ethics, innovation, accessibility and leadership. I’m also fascinated by the cutting edge of machine learning, so there's often links to strange and wonderful (and slightly worrying) AI projects.
