Reader's Digest approached NDP with the challenge of creating a new editorial website for the UK arm of the publication.

None of their great content was currently being published online, so our brief was to turn their fairly uninspiring web presence to a destination for people looking for trustworthy tips, advice, recipies and fun.

Working closely with the creative and development teams, I developed a structure for the site which was modern and easy to navigate, while still leaving plenty of room to grow.

The site has since been re-themed to match the US publication, but our planning and build lives on under the surface.
