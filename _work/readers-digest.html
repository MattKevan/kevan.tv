            <p>Reader's Digest approached NDP with the challenge of creating a new editorial website for the UK arm of the publication.

            <p>None of their great content was currently being published online, so our brief was to turn their fairly uninspiring web presence to a destination for people looking for trustworthy tips, advice, recipies and fun.

            <p>Working closely with the creative and development teams, I developed a structure for the site which was modern and easy to navigate, while still leaving plenty of room to grow.

            <p>The site has since been re-themed to match the US publication, but our planning and build lives on under the surface.</p>
