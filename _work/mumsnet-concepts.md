## Millennial branding

### Challenge

Research showed that people in their 20s and 30s now made up the majority of new parents, whereas the average Mumsnet user was in their mid-to-late 40s.

Accustomed to high-quality mobile app experiences, these younger users were being put off by Mumsnet's dated design and rigid desktop-optimised forum structure. Due to technical limitations of the forum, the editorial and social aspects of the site were almost completely separate, with very little ability to mix the two.

In addition newer competitors, such as Peanut and Hoop, had a much better experience on mobile. If Mumsnet was to remain relevant it needed to attract younger users for whom smartphones, messaging apps and social networks were second nature – and had probably never encountered a traditional forum.

### Solution

After researching competitor products, I created a mobile-first reimagining of both Mumsnet's social features and editorial content, combining them organically to create a unified experience. I deliberately stripped back the design, using a modern colour palette and fresh typography.

The organisation was going through a multi-year digital transformation project, paying down years of technical debt and re-platforming the  site on a modern foundation. These designs became a north-star vision, showing the kind of features that would be enabled once the transformation was complete.
