## Background

Founded by Oliver Jelf in 2007, The Illustration Gallery was one of the first galleries in the UK to focus on contemporary illustration and exhibited the work of some of the world's top illustrators, including Tom Gauld, Rob Ryan, Yuko Shimizu, eBoy and Sam Weber. In 2010 Oliver and I teamed up to turn the gallery into an online experience, building an online art gallery and shop.

## Challenge

The brief was to create a striking, instantly recognisable brand, with the same quality and feel as a national contemporary art gallery, such as the Barbican and Tate Modern. As the gallery was to be a showcase for contemporary illustration, the brand needed to work well with any style of artwork, without overshadowing or clashing with it.

## Solution

I designed the logo to sit at the top-right corner of the page, either by itself or on top of artwork, to act rather like a quality mark. I deliberately kept the identity minimal, to act as a neutral container for the artwork and not favour a particular artist or style.

## Implementation

As well as the brand, I created the gallery's publications, signage, flyers and built an e-commerce website with Drupal 6 and Ubercart.
