## Background
The Federation of British Artists (FBA) consists of nine artist societies, representing over 500  member artists, and is based at the Mall Galleries in London.

## The challenge

The FBA had larger ambitions than just wanting a better version of their existing site: they wanted to create an online space that both complimented and extended the exhibitons held in the gallery and showcased the work of their members.

## The solution

Gallery sites (done well) give you all the information you need about their exhibitions, but the artwork itself, beyond a few examples, is often omitted. If you want to see the work, the attitude tends to be, then visit the gallery.

In the age of art marketplaces like Artfinder and Artsy -- which aggregates thousands of galleries, exhibitions and artworks from around the world, this approach seemed out of step. 

The first decision I made with the client was that every artwork shown in an exhibition or that was part of their permanent collection would be listed on the site. This tied neatly into the FBA's plans to better promote the work of their member artists and enable people to buy art directly, rather than just in an exhibition.

Approaching the design as though it were an art marketplace, I first created the artwork detail page. This became the core of the site, everything else layering on top.

The detail page contained a series of high-quality images, information about the piece, the artist name, exhibitions the artwork had appeared in -- and most importantly, the price and purchasing information.

I then grouped the artwork into artist profiles and exhibition listings. As well as their artwork, artist profiles contained their artist statement, which society they belonged to and contact details to arrange a commission. Exhibition pages contained the exhibition details, and listed the artwork and artists involved.
