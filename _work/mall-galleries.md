## Background
The Federation of British Artists (FBA) consists of nine artist societies, representing over 500  member artists, and is based at the Mall Galleries in London.

## The challenge

The FBA had larger ambitions than just wanting a better version of their existing site: they wanted to create an online space that both complimented and extended the exhibitons held in the gallery and showcased the work of their members.

## The solution

Gallery sites are good at providing information about their exhibitions, but the artwork itself tends to be omitted â€“ if you want to see the work, visit the gallery.

I wanted to change this. Wouldn't it be better if it were possible to view and purchase any artwork in an exhibition directly on the website?

Approaching the design of the site as though it was an art marketplace, rather than an event listings site like most galleries, I started by creating an artwork detail page.

This contained a series of high-quality images and purchasing options, plus information about the piece including the artist, exhibitions it had featured in and more. I then created an artist profile page, which contained a list of their artwork, their artist statement, the society they belonged to and the exhibtions they'd participated in.
