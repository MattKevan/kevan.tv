## My role
* Lead UX designer
* Creative manager

## Background
The Mall Galleries, with its prestigious location on the Mall, is the London home of the Federation of British Artists (FBA), the umbrella body for a wide range of artist societies including the Royal Society of Watercolour Artists and [name]. 

## The challenge
The Mall Galleries had two aims for the website. Firstly, they wanted to improve the exhibition and event listings, making them more flexible and easier to use.

Secondly, and more interestingly, they wanted to turn the website into a platform for selling and commissioning artwork created by their member artists.

## The solution 
My concept was to complement and extend the exhibitions held in the gallery and to showcase the work of their member artists.

As well as providing information about the exhibition, it would be possible to browse and buy the artwork featured directly from exhibition pages.

Each artist would have a profile page, showing examples of their work, which exhibitions they’d been in and listing their artworks for sale. If they are taking commissions, it would be possible to contact them to start the process.

Lastly, there would be a shop section, where it would be possible to explore the artwork for sale, filtering by genre, artist, medium etc.

Over time, the website would build a history of all the artists who exhibitied at the gallery, alongside a collection of all their work.
