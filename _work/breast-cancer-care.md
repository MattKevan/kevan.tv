### Background

Breast Cancer Care (BCC) had developed a new strategy, using digital media to better deliver their support services. However, they felt their website was not up to the challenge – content was hard to find, and the build wasn't flexible enough to meet their new demands.

<p>NDP's brief was to provide strategic input from the start, rebuild the website and integrate it with a range of external systems, including the Lithium social forum platform and payment gateways.</p>

<h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>As creative manager and UX lead, my challenge was to take the initial information architecture created by an external UX agency, integrate BCC's desired new functionality (and features to be kept from the old site) and create a plan which could both be understood by BCC and used as a detailed blueprint for the development team.</p>
<p>This included creating site maps, system diagrams, hundreds of wireframes, detailed user journeys and more.</p>

<p>A key requirement from BCC was that the site should be easily extensible – it should be possible to add new sections and features without requiring extra design and development time. It was also clear that we were not going to be able to wireframe every page which needed it and still maintain a reasonable budget.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<p>To solve these problems I took the 'Atomic design' principle, and adapted it to work with Drupal. In short, atomic design is a system for design which takes the basic elements of a web page – headings, paragraphs, and builds them into modular 'molecules' which can be combined on various ways to form page templates. Therefore new templates can be built quickly from a library of pre-existing components.</p>

<p>Working closely with the design and development teams I created a style guide which showed how the basic HTML elements could be combined to form blocks, content displays – such as listings, teasers and grids, then how those elements could be combined to form templates, content types and more.</p>

<p>We carried this thinking through to the design, so new pages could be quickly created without having to design anything from scratch. Since the new site launched, we've created new sections and a redesigned homepage using the component system.
