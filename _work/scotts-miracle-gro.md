### Background

The UK arm of the company needed to increase visibility of specific products, and promote their image as a trusted source for all gardening needs. They decided to create an editorially-led website featuring high-quality, informative content for gardeners of all ages and abilities.

Their first version of the site had proved the concept was good, but more work was needed to fully realise its potential. The design needed improving, the build was not good enough to support their ongoing objectives â€“ and it needed to work well across mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Process

Working with Scott's digital team I conducted a basic survey with the intended audience. This allowed us to test our assumptions and make sure the content and structure would be useful for the intended audiences.

I developed the new site structure, creating site maps, user journeys and wireframes. During this process I worked closely with the design and development teams to ensure the designs could be built within the time and budget available.

### Landing pages

Part of the project was to create a series of landing pages, one for each of Scott's main brands. They had to be attention grabbing, well designed, and reflect the character of each brand.

As creative manager, I led a series of workshops to define the content, structure and layout of each landing page, and decided which animation techniques to use. Once the designs and storyboards had been signed off by Scott's brand teams, I then built and animated all but one of the landing pages.
