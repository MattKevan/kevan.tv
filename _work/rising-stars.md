Their aim was to give teachers access to the learning materials and related resources they or their schools had purchased by logging into a personalised members area.

As UX lead on the project, my role was to put together a comprehensive plan for the site, showing in detail how it would work. This process involved holding a series of workshops with different client stakeholders to capture their requirements and understand in-depth how they wanted it to function.
