## Background
Based on the Essex coast, Fellowship Afloat is a sailing and outdoor activity centre like no other. There’s a full range of things to do, including sailing, powerboating, canoeing, climbing and archery, but the most striking difference it that it’s based on a giant red lightship, visible for miles around.

It’s also a place that means a lot to me as I spent a lot of time there growing up, helping out with groups, having fun on boats or just generally getting muddy. So when Fellowship Afloat asked me to help create a new website I was happy to help, as it was an opportunity to give something back.

## The challenge
Everyone who’s actually been to the centre agrees what an amazing place it is – the experience of staying on a lightship surrounded by miles of nature, the range of activities and the warmth of the staff and volunteers (not to mention the great food).

My brief was to design and build a website that communicated the fun and excitement of staying at the centre, and the many different activities on offer.

## The solution

Over the course of a year I worked closely with Fellowship Afloat's staff and trustees to design and build their new site. They have a few quite different audiences, so the site structure needed to work well for each, while still giving a good overview of who Fellowship Afloat are and what makes them special.

The site also has booking functionality, so visitors can quickly sign up for sailing courses or away weeks. Phase two of development, kicking off later this year, will include setting up online payments and creating a members' only area for staff and volunteers.
