In 2013 I was invited by the Federation of British Artists to stage an exhibition of contemporary illustration at the Mall Galleries, their prestigious central London venue. 

With just six weeks to prepare, we exhibited a wide range of illustrators, from the world-famous to the up-and-coming, including the artists featured on our site, students from the University of Brighton and some of the UK's best graffiti writers.

As part of the exhibition we also arranged a programme of talks, workshops, live demonstrations and a comics and makers fair.

This was the first time the Mall Galleries had exhibitied such contemporary artwork, as well as the first time a comics fair had been held in a major national gallery.

Sadly we weren't able to feature Mr Sausage, a 20 foot inflatable sausage wearing a hat, as he was too big for the building.
