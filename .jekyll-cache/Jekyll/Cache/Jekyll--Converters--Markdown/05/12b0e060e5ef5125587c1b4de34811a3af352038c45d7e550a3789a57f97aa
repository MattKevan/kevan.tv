I"h<p>I launched UX Lift in 2017 as a way to organise the huge collection of UX and design links I’d built over the years.</p>

<p>As the site came together, I realised it could be useful to both to new and experienced designers. While there’s a lot of good resources out there, I hadn’t found anywhere that attempted to collect everything together in one place.</p>

<p>The site now contains many hundreds of links to articles, tools, books, resources, courses, publications and much more and I’m adding to it constantly.</p>

<h3 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h3>

<p>In 2020 I launched a twice-monthly newsletter, consisting of articles, tools, resources and more that I’ve found useful or discovered since the last edition. However, I have a particular interest in design ethics, innovation, accessibility and leadership.</p>

<p>I’m also fascinated by the cutting edge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, so there’s a lot of links to strange/wonderful/scary AI projects.</p>

<p>UX Lift is built with Jekyll, stored in Github and hosted by Netlify. The fonts are Plex Sans and Gentium Basic.</p>

<p>I started with a static site generator as it was simple to set up and  develop, but since then the site has grown to be very content heavy. If I’d known how big it would get I’d probably started with something more dynamic. I’ve started migrations to both Wordpress and Statamic, but at the moment Jekyll still does what I need.</p>

<p>I’ve written a bunch of scripts that automate content generation and publishing, and combined with a static CMS like Forestry.io, Jekyll has proven to be remarkably powerful.</p>
