I"Ó<p>To make good use of my commuting time, I set myself the challenge of creating at least three pieces of abstract art each journey, exploring form, colour, texture and variation.</p>

<p>Within this I set further boundaries: Each piece could take no longer than ten minutes, I could only use simple shapes and a limited colour palette, and everything had to be created solely on an iPhone.</p>

<p>Over the course of nine months I created more than 1000 images.</p>
