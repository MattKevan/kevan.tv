I"<p>Between 2004 and 2011 I was creative manager at Attend, responsible for writing, editing and designing the organisation’s publications, magazines and website. I was also responsible for implementing the organisation’s rebrand from National Association of Hospital and Community Friends (NAHCF) to Attend.</p>

<p>During this time I set up and ran a project that helped designers who had experienced traumatic brain injuries rehabilitate and return to work by providing design services to Attend’s member charities.</p>
