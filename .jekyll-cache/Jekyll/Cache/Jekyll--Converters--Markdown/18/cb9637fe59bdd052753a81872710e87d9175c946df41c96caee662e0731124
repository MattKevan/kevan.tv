<p>Research showed that people in their 20s and 30s now made up the majority of new parents, whereas the average Mumsnet user was in their mid-to-late 40s.</p>

<p>Accustomed to high-quality mobile app experiences, these younger users were put off by Mumsnet’s dated design and rigid forum structure. Due to technical limitations of the forum, the editorial and social aspects of the site were almost completely separate, with very little ability to mix the two.</p>

<p>In addition newer competitors, such as Peanut and Hoop, had a much better experience on mobile. To remain relevant, Mumsnet needed to attract younger users for whom smartphones, messaging apps and social networks were second nature – and had probably never encountered a traditional desktop-based forum.</p>

<p>After researching competitor products, 
I created a mobile-first reimagining of both Mumsnet’s social features and editorial content, combining them organically to create a unified experience. I deliberately stripped back the design, using a modern colour palette and fresh typography.</p>

<p>The organisation was going through a multi-year digital transformation project, paying down years of technical debt and re-platforming the  site on a modern foundation. These designs became a north-star vision, showing the kind of features that would be enabled once the transformation was complete.</p>

<p>Antenatal courses, such as those offered by NCT, are an key way expectant parents gain the knowledge and friendship networks they’ll need over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>However, these courses aren’t accessible to everyone, due to factors such as cost or physical location.</p>

<p>The question I wanted to answer was would it be possible to create a learning app that combined the best of Mumsnet’s online community with the best of an offline group experience?</p>

<p class="caption">↑ App screens, showing featured courses, group listing and course details.</p>

<h3 id="solution-1">Solution</h3>

<p>I started by conducting a deep-dive search through the forums, looking for peoples’ direct experience of both antenatal groups and online learning platforms. This gave me a set of real-life user pain points and needs I could base the design around.</p>

<p>The app would contain expert-led video content, which could be watched by users individually or socially in a chat group.</p>

<p>These groups would be formed around a  topic, a particular location or informally between friends and would provide the social aspect.</p>

<p>The decision was made not to progress any further with the idea, but it prompted the discussion as to where Mumsnet should go in the future and what new products it should create.</p>
