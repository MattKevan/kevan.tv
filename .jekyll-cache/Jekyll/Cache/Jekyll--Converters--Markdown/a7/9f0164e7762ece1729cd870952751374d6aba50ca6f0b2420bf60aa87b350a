I"!<p>If you’ve not heard of it, <a href="https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable">AIBU</a> is a place where you can ask the Mumsnet hivemind whether you’re being unreasonable about a particular issue or circumstance (quick tip: if you have to ask, you are). Favourite topics include the neighbours, shoddy parking, mothers in law, parents at school and the DH’s general uselessness. Swears abound.</p>

<p>Top AIBU threads at the time of writing include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To be getting sick of my next door neighbour?</li>
  <li>To wonder if anyone else will admit to being a soap dodger?</li>
  <li>To ask for your Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery success stories?</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most communities, Mumsnetters have developed their own particular slang and abbreviations, the knowledge of which is vital to fully understand what’s going on. Here’s a quick primer: DH is ‘dear husband’, OH is ‘other half’, DD is ‘dear daughter’, DS is ‘dear son’, MIL is ‘mother in law’, CF is ‘cheeky fucker’. You get the idea.</p>

<p>The question was: could an AI be just as unreasonable as an angry sleep-deprived parent?</p>

<p>After training a neural network on around 35,000 AIBU thread titles, it turns out that yes, yes it can.</p>

<h2 id="i-hereby-present-aibu--artificial-intelligences-being-unreasonable">I hereby present: AIBU – Artificial Intelligences Being Unreasonable</h2>

<p>Pleasingly it seems to have grasped the AIBU question construction and Mumsnet abbreviations. And it turns out that artificial intelligences are just as concerned with pets, schools, children and misbehaving partners as the rest of us. We’re not so different after all…</p>

<p>Changing the amount of randomness in the output affected the results more than I expected. Set it too low, and it just banged on about schools and job interviews like a tired dad at the end of a party.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To think that the school should be able to get a job interview?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, setting it high got it so hyper it lost all coherence, like a toddler hopped up on E numbers and cake.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To wonder what the hen keep is not a handbag based?</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting the randomness to about 70% seemed to be about right – the results could be a bit mad at times, but then so are a lot of the real ones. There’s plenty which I’m sure must have actually been posted before, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aibu - help please</li>
  <li>To be furious about the state of this laundry</li>
  <li>AIBU to ask what happened to the police?</li>
  <li>AIBU to go back out</li>
  <li>AIBU to ask what you would do?</li>
  <li>To have been a bit angry about this</li>
  <li>To be frustrated with the NHS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn">textgenrnn</a> a character-based Python 3 neural network built on top of Keras/TensorFlow. The data source was three years of AIBU thread titles saved as a text file.</p>

<p>I tried running the training locally on my laptop, setting the training to three epochs. This took ages – around an hour for each epoch – and didn’t give particularly good results.</p>

<p>For the next attempt, I discovered it was possible to run the training with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMKGnVxirJnqDViH7BDJxFqWrsXlPSoK/view">Google’s Colaboratory</a>, basically Google Docs for code. With Colaboratory it took about 45 minutes to run 10 epochs. Apparently Google’s servers are faster than a three-year-old MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Once done, I downloaded the trained models to run locally.</p>
