I"<p>Launched in 2012, Illustrators was a joint project between myself and Oliver Jelf.</p>

<p>The site was a curated multi-vendor marketplace for illustrators to promote and sell their artwork. Artists received orders directly from customers and shipped out the artwork themselves.</p>

<p>We featured over 30 artists, both up-and-coming and well established, including Tom Gauld, Tony Meeuwissen, Martin Grover, Laura Huges and Marcus Walters.</p>

<p>While I had to close Illustrators in 2018 due to work and family pressures, it was an enormously fun project: it kicked off a new career in user experience and web development, I met loads of interesting people and had the chance to stage an exhibition in a <a href="/work/lineup/">major national gallery</a>.</p>

<p>I built Illustrators with Drupal 7, Ubercart Marketplace and Stripe. This was the first project I’d built of this scale and complexity - a head-first dive into Drupal, front-end development and e-commerce.</p>
