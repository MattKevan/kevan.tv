I")<p>In 2013 Illustrators was invited by the Federation of British Artists to stage an exhibition of contemporary illustration in their central London gallery.</p>

<p>With only six weeks to prepare, we exhibited a wide range of illustrators, from the world-famous to the up-and-coming, including students from the University of Brighton and some of the UK’s best graffiti artists. As part of the exhibition we also held talks, workshops, live demonstrations and a comics and makers fair.</p>

<p>This was the first time the Mall Galleries had exhibitied such contemporary artwork, as well as the first comics fair to be held in a major national gallery.</p>
