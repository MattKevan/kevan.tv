I"*<p>Attend is the membership body for volunteering organisations in hospitals and other healthcare settings, with over 29,000 volunteers across the UK.</p>

<p>Between 2004 and 2011, I led the organisation’s creative team, a mix of staff and volunteers, to manage the organisation’s brand, produce publications and maintain the website.</p>

<p>While at Attend I wrote, edited and designed their annual reviews and quarterly supporter magazine, produced a wide range of leaflets and publications, made videos and much more.</p>

<p>I also set up and ran a project that helped designers who’d experienced aquired brain injuries gain experience and return to work by providing design services to Attend’s member charities, acting as an in-house design agency.</p>
