<p>Research showed that people in their 20s and 30s now made up the majority of new parents, whereas the average Mumsnet user was in their mid-to-late 40s.</p>

<p>Accustomed to high-quality mobile app experiences, these younger users were being put off by Mumsnetâ€™s dated design and rigid desktop-optimised forum structure. Due to the limitations of the forum, the editorial and social aspects of the site were almost completely separate, with very little overlap between the two.</p>

<p>In addition, newer competitors were springing up, such as Peanut and Hoop, who had a much better experience on mobile. If Mumsnet was to remain relevant, it needed to attract younger users for whom smartphones, messaging apps and social networks were second nature â€“ and had probably not encountered a traditional forum before.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>After researching competitor products, I created a mobile-first reimagining of both Mumsnetâ€™s social features and editorial content, combining them organically to create a unified experience. I deliberately stripped back the design, using a modern colour palette and fresh typography.</p>
