I"à<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Mumsnet is the UKâ€™s largest parenting website, and one of the UKâ€™s largest websites, with over 1.2 billion annual pageviews. With the aim of making lives easier for parents, the website consists of a lively community forum, plus articles and videos on a wide range of parenting and non-parenting issues.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Mumsnet was founded over 20 years ago, and over the years new sections, features and pages were added in a variety of technologies and frameworks. Older parts of the site were not at all responsive, while some sections had a separate mobile theme, whereas newer sections were fully responsive. Fonts, design and layout changed between sections.</p>

<p><img src="/images/work/MN Nav 1.png" class="fullwidth" /></p>

<p>This resulted in a site that was almost impossible to navigate, as sections in the main menu in one part of the site became buried two or three levels down or were non-existent in others. The mobile version of some pages had a different main navigation to the desktop version. Across the site, there were seven different headers and three different footers.</p>

<p>This situation was hurting usability as there was no consistent site structure, and it also wasnâ€™t helping SEO as search engines would get a different view of the site depending on which page â€“ or version of the page â€“ they indexed. In addition, a large amount of Mumsnetâ€™s traffic goes to forum content â€“ editorial content is not widely viewed unless itâ€™s found through search â€“ so a secondary goal was to increase traffic to articles by making them easier to get to.</p>

<p>My challenge was to create a consistent header and footer that could be rolled out across the site, irrespective of the underlying technology or front-end framework.</p>

<h2 id="my-solution">My solution</h2>
<h3 id="data-and-content-strategy">Data and content strategy</h3>
<p>It was vital that the new navigation made sense from a user perspective, rather than reflecting the company structure. To do this I used analytics data to group the most popular topics. These became the top-level menu items, and the most popular subjects within each became the second and third level items.</p>

<p>I then conducted a content audit, creating an index of every hub and content page on the site. Working with the content team, we decided which pages would go into each topic, creating a site map content hierarchy.</p>

<h3 id="usability-testing">Usability testing</h3>
<p>Before beginning design and development work, I conducted a series of tree tests with users both familiar and unfamiliar with Mumsnet. Setting a series of tasks, I asked people to find both top-level and nested content to make sure they could find it using the new site structure.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-prototyping">Design and prototyping</h3>
<p>After the structure was agreed, I created a series of wireframes, prototypes and designs to test variations until we arrived at a solution liked by the majority of users.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Creating the new header and footer was a challenge. The code had to work flawlessly across desktop and mobile, be fully SEO optimised and accessible â€“ and, the hardest bit, work on any page across the site without either breaking itself, or the surrounding page. I worked closely with the development team throughout this process to test code, make suggestions for improvements, and provide design guidance where necessary.</p>

<h3 id="launch">Launch</h3>
<p>This was a big change to the site, much too risky to launch in one go. If anything went wrong, the backlash from our users would be swift and fierce.</p>

<p>To mitigate this, I developed a staggered launch strategy, first releasing to 5% of users, and then upping the amount each week, until finally it was made available to all users.</p>

<p>Good communications with the community would be key to the new navigation to being accepted, so immediately after the launch I wrote a post explaining the rationale for the project and asked users to give their feedback. I triaged the responses, making rapid updates and changes based on the comments as they came in.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>
<p>Mumsnet users can be highly resistant to change, but due to the way Iâ€™d handled comments and the rapid post-launch improvements we made the new header and footer was accepted quickly.</p>

<p>After launch, the header click-through rate increased by 200%, and clicks to content increased by 77%.</p>
