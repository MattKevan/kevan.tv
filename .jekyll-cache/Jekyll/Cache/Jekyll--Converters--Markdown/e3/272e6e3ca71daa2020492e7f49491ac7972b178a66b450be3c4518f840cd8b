I"°<p>Split into two halves, Indistractable first explains the causes and triggers for distraction, then gives some strategies and tactics for managing it in various contexts, such at work, in the home, and with the family. Both halves are worth reading, but the first half is the strongest as it explores the motivation and triggers for distraction, while the strategies in the second half are basic and better covered elsewhere.</p>
