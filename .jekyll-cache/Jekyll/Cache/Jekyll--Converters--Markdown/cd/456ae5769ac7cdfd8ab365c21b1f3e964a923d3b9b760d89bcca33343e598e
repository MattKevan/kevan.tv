I"ó<p>In 2013 I was invited by the Federation of British Artists to stage an exhibition of contemporary illustration at the Mall Galleries, their prestigious central London gallery.</p>

<p>With only six weeks to prepare, we exhibited a wide range of illustrators, from the world-famous to the up-and-coming, including the artists featured on our site, students from the University of Brighton and some of the UKâ€™s best graffiti writers.</p>

<p>As part of the exhibition we also arranged a programme of talks, workshops, live demonstrations and a comics and makers fair.</p>

<p>This was the first time the Mall Galleries had exhibitied such contemporary artwork, as well as the first time a comics fair had been held in a major national gallery.</p>

<p>Sadly we werenâ€™t allowed to include Mr Sausage, a 20 foot inflatable sausage wearing a hat.</p>
