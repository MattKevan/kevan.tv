I"`<p>Opened by Oliver Jelf in 2007, The Illustration Gallery was one of the first galleries in the UK to focus on contemporary illustration and exhibited the work of some of the worldâ€™s top illustrators, including Tom Gauld, Rob Ryan, Yuko Shimizu, eBoy and Sam Weber.</p>

<p>I was responsible for creating the brand, as well as designing the exhibition flyers and publications. The brief for the brand was that it should have the same quality and feel as a national contemporary art gallery, such as the Barbican or the Tate Modern.</p>

<p>In 2011, Oliver and I joined forces to launch an online version of the gallery, creating a curated marketplace for illustrators to sell their work.</p>
