I"M<p>Launched in 2012, Illustrators was a joint project between myself and Oliver Jelf.</p>

<p>A curated marketplace for illustrators to promote and sell their artwork, it had a similar business model to sites such as Etsy, where artists received orders directly from the customer and shipped out the artwork themselves.</p>

<p>We featured over 30 artists, both up-and-coming and well established, including Tom Gauld, Tony Meeuwissen, Martin Grover, Laura Huges and Marcus Walters.</p>

<p>Although I had to close Illustrators in 2018 due to work and family pressures, it was an enormously fun project: it kicked off a new career in user experience and web development, I met loads of interesting people and had the chance to stage an exhibition in a major national gallery.</p>

<p>I built Illustrators with Drupal 7, Ubercart Marketplace and Stripe. This was the first project I’d built of this scale and complexity - a head-first dive into Drupal, front-end development and e-commerce and the beginning of a new career in UX and product design.</p>
