<p>Research showed that people in their 20s and 30s now made up the majority of new parents, whereas the average Mumsnet user was in their mid-to-late 40s.</p>

<p>Accustomed to high-quality mobile app experiences, these younger users were being put off by Mumsnet’s dated design and rigid desktop-optimised forum structure. Due to technical limitations of the forum, the editorial and social aspects of the site were almost completely separate, with very little ability to mix the two.</p>

<p>In addition newer competitors, such as Peanut and Hoop, had a much better experience on mobile. If Mumsnet was to remain relevant, it needed to attract younger users for whom smartphones, messaging apps and social networks were second nature – and had probably not encountered a traditional forum before.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>After researching competitor products, I created a mobile-first reimagining of both Mumsnet’s social features and editorial content, combining them organically to create a unified experience. I deliberately stripped back the design, using a modern colour palette and fresh typography.</p>

<p>The organisation was in the progress of going through a multi-year digital transformation project, paying down years of technical debt and re-platforming the  site on a modern foundation. These designs became a north-star vision, showing the kind of features that would possible once the transformation was complete.</p>
