I"s<p>I launched UX Lift in 2017 as a way to organise the huge collection of UX and design links I’d built over the years.</p>

<p>As the site came together, I realised it could be useful to both to new and experienced designers. While there’s a lot of good resources out there, I hadn’t found anywhere that attempted to collect everything together in one place.</p>

<p>The site now contains many hundreds of links to articles, tools, books, resources, courses, publications and much more and I’m adding to it constantly.</p>

<h3 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h3>

<p>In 2020 I launched a twice-monthly newsletter consisting of articles, tools, resources and more that I’ve found useful or discovered since the last edition. However, I have a particular interest in design ethics, innovation, accessibility and leadership.</p>

<p>I’m also fascinated by the cutting edge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, so there’s a lot of links to strange/wonderful/scary AI projects.</p>
