I"_<p>Introduced in 1991, Gopher is a lightweight protocol designed for distributing, searching and retrieving documents over the Internet. Itâ€™s long been supplanted by HTTP and the modern Web as we know it, but it stubbornly clings to life in various places. And thereâ€™s many reasons why in 2019 itâ€™s still an interesting choice to use.</p>

<h2 id="why-gopher-why-now">Why Gopher? Why now?</h2>

<p><strong>Itâ€™s lightweight and fast.</strong> Gopher pages are just plain text, in compariston to web pages which can contain many megabytes of images, CSS, ads and tracking scripts. Perfect for low-bandwidth connections and low powered machines.</p>

<p><strong>Itâ€™s interesting.</strong> Itâ€™s fun to see how the Internet got to where it is today and to explore pre-Web technologies. Had Tim Berners Lee never sat down in front of his Next cube and written HTTP, we may all still be using Gopher today.</p>

<p><strong>Itâ€™s noncommercial.</strong> The Web as we know it today is dominated by megacorporations, turning the dream of a better world through cyberspace into a surveillance capitalism nightmare. Gopher sidesteps all of that. A hark back to a simpler and more optimistic time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-browse-gopher-sites">How do I browse Gopher sites?</h2>

<p>Gopher isnâ€™t supported natively by most Web browsers, but thereâ€™s still plenty of ways to access Gopher content:</p>

<h4 id="gopher-on-ios">Gopher on iOS</h4>

<p>I was delighted to find there is a native iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gopher-client/id1235310088">Gopher client</a> â€“ Â£1.99 well spent.</p>

<h4 id="gopher-on-the-mac">Gopher on the Mac</h4>

<p>After exploring a bunch of alternatives, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a> text-only browser worked best. Install with <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install lynx</code>. Accessing a Gopher site is as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lynx gopher://&lt;site-url&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="gopher-in-a-browser">Gopher in a browser</h4>

<p>There are <a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/burrow-gopherspace-explor/plhaaggiajlcjclagmjnjmaonhkdhhji">Chrome</a> extensions, and Floodgap maintains a <a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/">Gopher-to-HTTP proxy</a>, enabling access to any Gopher site in a standard Web browser.</p>

<h2 id="what-content-can-i-find">What content can I find?</h2>

<p>I was surprised at how much content is actually available. Most Gopher sites are hosted by enthusiasts or community-run servers, and itâ€™s all determinedly, refreshingly non-commercial. Hereâ€™s some recommended links, though youâ€™ll need one of the clients above to view them:</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://gopher.floodgap.com">Floodgap</a></strong> â€“Â Probably the best place to start exploring Gopherspace. As well as hosting Veronica-2, a Gopher search engine, Floodgap also links to a wide range of Gopher resources.</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://gopherpedia.com">Gopherpedia</a></strong> â€“ A direct Gopher interface to Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://hngopher.com">Hacker News</a></strong> â€“ A mirrored version of Hacker News, updated hourly.</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://gopherreddit.com">Gophereddit</a></strong> â€“ Simple Gopher interface to Reddit.</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/world">Floodgapâ€™s list of known servers</a></strong> â€“ All servers found by the Veronica-2 search engine.</p>

<p><strong><a href="gopher://gopher.kevan.tv">Kevan.tv</a></strong> â€“Â A work-in-progress Gopher version of this site.</p>
