The brain then presents this information in the mind, creating an internal representation of reality. These representations may be in the form of images, sounds, sensations, and/or movements and correspond to the representation systems of visual (V), auditory (A) and kinesthetic (K), respectively. We also have another internal meta-representation system—auditory digital (Ad)—which uses language in the mind to process events. These four systems are often written as VAKAd.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Frontend Communication Channel Preferences</h2><p id="Par5" class="Para">Most of us (but not all) have a preferred representational system that favors the related communication channel: visual - sight, auditory - music and sounds, kinesthetic - sensations and movement, or auditory digital - words. We pay more attention to our favored channel for information and, in some instances, strongly neglect one or more of the other channels. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">9-1</a></span> shows the frontend layer of the Humans as a Full Stack model presented in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:5.62em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The frontend layer</span></h6></div><p id="Par6" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">For the majority of the people we interact with, if we want to influence and connect with them, we must use <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">their</em> preferred channel to communicate. If they have a preference for the visual channel, we need to communicate with them using images, drawings, pictures, video, etc. If their preferred channel is auditory, then active conversation and the appropriate utilization of sound and even music will likely be most effective.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">We can often identify the other person’s preferred channel by the language that they use. The sentences they use to describe thoughts and thinking often contain clues to their preferred channel. For instance:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par8" class="Para"><span id="ITerm1">Visual preference</span>: “It looks right,” “I can’t see the problem”</p></li><li><p id="Par9" class="Para"><span id="ITerm2">Auditory preference</span>: “It sounds right,” “That sounds interesting”</p></li><li><p id="Par10" class="Para"><span id="ITerm3">Kinesthetic preference</span>: “It feels right,” “I sense a problem”</p></li></ul><p id="Par11" class="Para">We can also gain insight into a person’s representational system by observing their eye movements. When a person is processing events (and doesn't know you are looking at their eye movements), their eye direction typically corresponds to the area of the brain they are accessing to process the event. There are six key eye accessing locations, shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">9-2</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:19.3em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">

You can trigger this process by asking someone: “How did you feel when …?”</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">As we converse naturally with someone (either face-to-face or over a video conference call), we can pay attention to their eye accessing cues to help us determine their communication preferences. Equally observing whether they are creating or recalling can help us to determine if they are being truthful. A person who is explaining a conversation they had with a key stakeholder and has eye movements that are primarily in either audio or visual construction will likely not be telling us the whole truth. There is very little need to construct something that has already happened!</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">It should be noted that, like left and right handed people, the majority of us are wired with construction on the right side (as per Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">9-2</a></span>). Some, however, are wired in reverse (flipping the diagram on the horizontal axis), essentially switching construction with recall and A<sup>id</sup> with K<sup>i</sup>. Asking the determining questions provided here helps us to calibrate which way a person is wired before making any judgment and investigating further.</p></div></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Meta-Programs Layer</h2><p id="Par20" class="Para">Our preferences and patterns of thinking are shaped by the meta-programs we run in our minds. As their name implies, meta-programs are like microservices—small pieces of software that run at a meta level in the brain, creating a frame of mind (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">9-3</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:8.77em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">The meta-programs <span id="ITerm11">layer</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par21" class="Para">Each meta-program colors the way we perceive the external world as we recreate it in the mind, and each is context specific. Michael Hall’s neurosemantics work and in particular, his book <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Figuring Out People,</em><a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a> identifies and describes the different meta-programs that we all run.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">When you take a Myers-Briggs personality assessment, you get a four-letter result like ENTF or INTJ. These four letters represent Myers-Briggs’ idea (not mine) of the pivotal meta-programs that describe people. Their assessment confusingly returns one letter for each meta-program that denotes which end of that meta-program continuum they have determined your personality to be at. The first of the four letters is either an “I” or an “E” and indicates whether we have been classified as an introvert or extrovert. Introvert and extrovert are actually the opposite ends of the Rejuvenation meta-program, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">9-4</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.48em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-4. </span><span class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm12">Rejuvenation</span> meta-program</span></h6></div><p id="Par24" class="Para">The challenge with the <span id="ITerm13">Myers-Briggs assessment</span><span id="ITerm14">
                
              </span> is threefold:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par25" class="Para">Meta-programs are a continuous spectrum, not a binary choice. In the Rejuvenation meta-program example, an Ambivert (someone who is both introverted and extraverted) would likely get a different letter each time they took the assessment. Every meta-program is a continuum and therefore representing a meta-program result as one end of the spectrum reduces the validity of the assessment.</p></li><li><p id="Par26" class="Para">Meta-programs are context-specific and therefore change according to context. You may be a big picture thinker at work and quite detail orientated at home or with your car. The assessment needs to be clear on the context of the questions being asked and the results only applied to that context, not all aspects of life.</p></li><li><p id="Par27" class="Para">There are 60 <span id="ITerm15">meta-programs</span><span id="ITerm16">
                      
                    </span> in total that run in our minds, and therefore the meta-programs that are useful to look at depend on what we are seeking to achieve. Later in this chapter, we look at the meta-programs that impact our ability to evolve, interact with, and lead others effectively.</p></li></ul></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">How Meta-Programs Are <span id="ITerm17">Configured</span></h2><p id="Par28" class="Para">Meta-programs are configured by our repeated thoughts and emotions and our mental states that we habituate over time. A lot of these meta-programs are set up early on in our life as our parents rewarded or punished our behaviors in either subtle or direct ways.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">Imagine these scenarios: there is a young boy aged 6. His mother tells him that if he keeps his bedroom tidy for the whole week, he will get an extra dollar pocket money as a reward. The little boy is motivated by this as he is saving up for the latest and greatest toy he’s wanted for so long. So he agrees to the deal and tidies his bedroom. His mother comes into his bedroom every Saturday morning and inspects it for tidiness and, if he passes, he gets the dollar.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">In scenario A: The mother comes to his bedroom each Saturday morning, opens the door and glances in from the doorway to see if the floor is cleared of his dirty clothes, that there are no dirty dishes or glasses on his desk, and that his toys are all put away out of sight.</p><p id="Par31" class="Para">In scenario B: The mother comes into his bedroom and opens each desk drawer, looks under the bed, opens the cupboards and checks that everything is neat and tidy and in its correct place and neatly organized. She may even wipe her finger over surfaces and check for dust or grime.</p><p id="Par32" class="Para">Over time, (maybe years) the mother in scenario B (either consciously or unconsciously) programs the boy for detail. That is to say she configures the child’s Scale meta-program for the detail end of the spectrum. In scenario A, the boy is more likely to be global orientated because these are the formative years of the boy’s life. This configuration gets set quite solidly and unconsciously and he begins to value detail (or not) and apply it to other aspects of his life. It may even draw him into a detail-oriented career such as accounting. His value of this detailed way of being is then projected onto others, such that he likes and appreciates others that he sees as diligent, structured, and therefore doing a good job!</p><p id="Par33" class="Para">Neither end of the <span id="ITerm18">spectrum</span> (detail or global) is better than the other. What tends to cause challenges for us is when we are fixed (or driven) at one end of meta-program, which then impacts our life in a negative way. Highly global people often complain about the boring minutiae and trivial details of life and avoid them, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. Equally, highly detailed people are frustrated by global people who talk so vaguely they just can’t understand what the conversation is about or what is being asked of them.</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">The key to evolution, and indeed to a better life, is to be aware of the existence of meta-programs, to be aware of the ones that drive us, and to be aware of the ones that impact what we are trying to achieve. The great news is that meta-programs are re-programmable! Like habits, they take time and effort, but we can change them. Sometimes they change on their own without any conscious effort from us. Sometimes they take real focus, determination, and time to shift.</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">So, let’s explore the essential meta-programs for our journey together and learn how to shift and upgrade them.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Convincer Meta-Programs</h2><p id="Par36" class="Para">This book, in part, is about convincing you of the need to change, that I have something valuable for you to take away and use, and that, with intention and attention, it is possible for you to change dramatically.</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">Convincing people, whether it’s a stakeholder, peer, or spouse, can be very hard at times. The relationship involved brings elements such as trust and respect, which are absolutely essential to influence and convincing. However, there are a set of four meta-programs that, when understood, help us realize how to best convince someone. Let’s take a look at them next.</p><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm19">Relationship Comparison</span>: Matching or Mismatching</h3><p id="Par38" class="Para">This is the relationship we have with new information received. Do we match it with what we already know and look for how it’s the same or how it differs from what we already know? It’s my direct experience that a majority of technologists mismatch new information with our pervasive response of “Yes, but”. This mismatching helps us look for exceptions to the rule, for faults, or for how it might be wrong as we test the robustness of the data. To test this meta-program with someone, you may ask them “What’s the relationship between your first job and your current one?”. People wired for matching will first identify the similarities in the roles. Mismatchers will immediately identify the differences. In instances where a person is wired strongly at one end, they may not be able to identify the issues at the end other end of the spectrum.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">When convincing someone, strong mismatchers can present a challenge. We may need to be ready with a thorough set of answers to their objections or we could mismatch their mismatching early on. If we were to lead with a sentence such as: “You aren’t going to say yes to this but…, “ a compulsive mismatcher will hear that sentence and instinctively want to say “yes” to the request.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Convincer <span id="ITerm20">Representation</span>: Looks, Sounds, Feels, or Makes Sense</h3><p id="Par40" class="Para">This meta-program has four points on the spectrum, rather than the usual two. This meta-program processes information differently based on the values we place on our experiences. We develop different emotional strategies for how we feel convinced. These are often related to our primary representational systems or communication channels, which are visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and auditory digital. Those of us with a preference for auditory digital, for instance, will have a level of internal self-talk as we make a decision and decide on the validity of something. Most people use language that explicitly points to this process. When they are convinced, they will often say “Yes, that looks right” or “Yes, that sounds right”.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">The key to <span id="ITerm21">working</span> with this meta-program is to be aware of the other person's preference and, if need be, adapt your style (your preference) to meet theirs, matching their language and biases. For visual people, drawing a concept on a whiteboard and asking them if it looks right is usually far more effective than talking to them and asking whether it sounds right.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Convincer <span id="ITerm22">Demonstration</span>: Number of Times or Length of Time</h3><p id="Par42" class="Para">Quite simply, this meta-program describes how some people require new concepts or information to be repeated multiple times before being convinced, whereas others require the new concept to sit with them for a period of time. Being convinced doesn’t simply consist of whether something looks or sounds right; it involves how we make choices and the processing of decision making. An essential part of this is the specific trust involved. The more trust, the less repetition or length of time is required to make a decision.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">Some need a concept to be repeatedly exposed to them numerous times before it seems real and trustworthy. Others need the idea of the concept to solidify over time.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm23">Authority Source</span>: Internal or External</h3><p id="Par44" class="Para">When making a decision about external information, where does our authority come from? If it’s external, we allow others to direct our choices and validate what is right or wrong, useful or not. If it’s internal, we decide on our own. Those of us with internal authority tend to be more difficult to convince, especially if we are at early developmental level such as Expert, where self-awareness is not fully developed.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">Take a moment to reflect and understand your own convincer preferences. Are you mismatching what’s being presented here in this book? Do the visuals throughout the book convince you more? Do you need to read some sections a few times, or enjoy the book concepts for a period of time? Do you have a strong sense of internal authority? Is it accurate? What does understanding this mean to your relationships at work and at home?</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">When you have thought about these, ask yourself this <span id="ITerm24">question</span>: Are these temporary strategies you have for learning and decision making working for you? If not, skip to the “Tuning Meta-Programs for Success” section and then come back here when you are ready for more.</p></div></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Meta-Programs for Evolving Faster Than the Pace of Change</h2><p id="Par47" class="Para">I can lead you to water but I cannot make you drink. You have to want to evolve; you have to want to change. You have to put the effort in, to paddle back out into the swell and ride that next wave. This sustained effort is fueled by our personal motivators.</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">Our personal motivators are critical in driving our effort to change (or not) and whether we evolve faster than the pace of change. Setting meaningful goals that align with our motivations allows us to focus our effort and energy on what we want. We set a stake in the ground for an outcome we desire and often we declare a time frame in which to achieve it. For some of us this works really well, for others not so much. For some, it works well for certain goals, but then not for others. The key to setting goals and intentions that work is to understand how we are individually motivated.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">There are four key meta-programs that impact our motivations to evolve, set goals, and achieve them, and they are discussed in the following sections.</p><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Nature: Static or Process</h3><p id="Par50" class="Para">I introduced the concept of the growth mindset in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_6_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">6</span></a></span>. The <span id="ITerm25">Nature</span> meta-program filters how we perceive who we are, whether we are static (fixed) or an evolving (growth) process. This program is usually set early on to be quite fixed (or static) for most of us in the western world. Over time, as we progress through the stages of development to Achiever and Catalyst, the meta-program moves toward Process. At even later stages of development, the Nature meta-program moves almost completely to Process as we see ourselves, others, the world, and indeed the universe as one unfolding process.</p><p id="Par51" class="Para">If you are strongly fixed at the static end of the spectrum, you are going to struggle to find the motivation to change, as you don’t believe you can. The good news is you are reading this book and you have come this far, so something inside of you wants more and knows this isn’t true. Keep reading, keep going; you’re doing awesome!</p></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Motivation Direction: Toward or Away From</h3><p id="Par52" class="Para">Understanding our <span id="ITerm26">motivation direction</span> is fundamental to our quality of life. Humans are generally motivated toward something—a goal or desire—or away from something such as pain or fear.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para">If your motivation strategy is “away from,” you won’t be moved to do this work until you have to. Maybe your job is threatened; maybe your business is crumbling around you or maybe you can’t find any work. You may be also be in a successful business looking into the future and have anxiety about your market’s disruption and competition. Away from motivation is very strong, usually stronger than toward motivation, but it’s not a pleasant experience.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">Being motivated “toward” something—something we want to do to create a different future for ourselves, others, and the planet is inspiring, positive, uplifting, and a lot less stressful. The key here is to focus on the future and create what you want to be motivated toward.</p><p id="Par55" class="Para">What is it that is motivating you to become a better leader?</p></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Scenario Type: Pessimist or <span id="ITerm27">Optimist</span></h3><p id="Par56" class="Para">I think most of us are aware of this concept. Are you optimistic about the future and think that all will go well? Or are you a pessimist, processing what might or will go wrong. Socially, optimists are more positively regarded; they are upbeat and engaging people to be around. What most people don’t understand is that optimists can make highly ineffective leaders. People who are overly optimistic take bigger risks, tend not to plan as much, and may not take action when it’s needed, because they think all will be okay. The key, as with most meta-programs, is to have a healthy balance of optimism and pessimism. To believe that you can change and evolve, that your new vision of the future can be achieved, and maybe there will be challenges ahead that you need to account for and action.</p></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Goal Striving: <span id="ITerm28">Skeptic-Optimization-Perfectionism</span></h3><p id="Par57" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm29">Goal Striving</span> meta-program filters how we approach a goal. Are we skeptical about achieving it? Do we optimize for most efficiency or do we try to achieve perfection? There is a direct relationship between the developmental levels and how we do Goal Striving. Experts tend to run a Perfectionism Goal Striving program, and achievers an Optimization strategy. Often, the most appropriate for leadership goals is optimization. Perfectionism has its place, but generally not at the higher levels of leadership.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">We can all benefit from adjusting, even slightly, just one of these motivational meta-programs, whoever we are. Unnatural Selection is about dialing these meta-programs in and creating the best mental frames and state of mind for excellence and success.</p></div></div><div id="Sec20" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Tuning Meta-Programs for Success</h2><p id="Par59" class="Para">Meta-programs are flexible. With effort we can tune and adjust them; in fact, we are constantly tuning meta-programs either consciously or subconsciously as we grow throughout our life. Our meta-programs are not our fixed destiny. They are, however, incredibly valuable because of their discrete and tangible nature. This discreteness and the fact that we can adjust them makes them an incredibly powerful tool for us to use in our evolution.</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">The six-step process (modified slightly from Michael Hall’s, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Figuring Out People</em>) to tune or adjust our position on a particular meta-program is as <span id="ITerm30">follows</span>:
</p><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List3"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par61" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">You have already begun to become aware of meta-programs and how they are structured.</em> This awareness changes your subjective experience into a more objective system to understand. Objectivity is key to shifting what and who we believe we are—our personalities.</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par62" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Identify which meta-programs are causing a challenge.</em> Are you finding that you are mismatching people and concepts excessively and it’s caused you professional and personal issues?

If we consider the Relationship Comparison meta-program, we have Matching and Mismatching at either end. Some people match most of what they experience while others mismatch. If some people match and others mismatch, then we know that this way of operating is programmed and not fixed and concrete.</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">We then think about and imagine what it would be like to operate at each extreme end of the spectrum. We imagine scenarios where we match everything others say and do. We experience what it’s like to be a matcher. We then flip to the other end of the spectrum and imagine what it would be like to mismatch everything. We experience being a mismatcher. In doing this process, we see and experience the polarity of each end of the spectrum.</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par65" class="Para"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Describe your new preferred style of</em> <span id="ITerm31">

What will operating in a balanced Matching-Mismatching manner bring you?

Define this trial period and give yourself permission to experiment—to see what it’s like to play with the new aspects of the meta-program. To gain flexibility of meta-program, it often helps to try on the other extreme for a while. As we try on this opposite way of being, we get to experience the stark contrast of Matching (if you were a Mismatcher). After the trial period ends, decrease your focus and effort on matching but, the experience is integrated back into how you operate. The amount of integration depends on the effort and value we place on operating in this new way. For some leaders, the integration requires further cycles of the trial period to fully integrate and gain flexibility.</p></li></ol><div id="Sec21" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">A Meta-Program Tuning <span id="ITerm33">Example</span></h3><p id="Par68" class="Para">A common meta-program that leaders tune is the Attention meta-program (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">9-5</a></span>). It is a valuable meta-program to tune, as it strongly impacts how effective we are as leaders. This meta-program describes how much we focus our attention on ourselves versus on others.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.18em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-5. </span><span class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm34">Attention</span> meta-program</span></h6></div><p id="Par69" class="Para">At one end we place our attention on ourselves, focusing on what we need and want and on our opinions. At the other end, we focus on the needs, desires, and views of others.</p><p id="Par70" class="Para">Being stuck at either end tends to cause challenges—solely focusing on self is essentially narcissistic in nature and often leads to poor stakeholder relationships and poor team engagement and productivity as we force through our agendas, demands, and viewpoints.</p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Being solely focused on others can lead to tactical operations, as we service our team or more indecisively as we focus on the multiple needs of our stakeholders. Unnatural Leaders balance this meta-program, holding a sense of what they want to achieve (their vision, their goals, etc.) while simultaneously focusing on the growth of their people and building lasting relationships with stakeholders.</p><div id="Sec22" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Steps 1-<span id="ITerm35">3</span></h4><p id="Par72" class="Para">We have understood meta-programs and how they operate (Step 1) and we have identified that the <span id="ITerm36">Attention</span> meta-program is the one we want to work on (Step 2). We have outlined the two ends of the meta-program as Self and Others and defined what operating at each end means (Step 3). We continue Step 3 by diving deeper into this to understand what it means for us personally to operate at either end. For this scenario, let’s assume that we are operating (like a majority of leaders) close to the Self end of the spectrum, so we chose to imagine what it would be like to operate at the opposite end—Others.</p></div><div id="Sec23" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Step 4</h4><p id="Par73" class="Para">During this step, we articulate what it means to have balance and attend to Self and Others. In a leadership context this balance usually leads to a more engaged team, improved stakeholder relationships, and outcomes that aligned across all of these goals. This means our operation now involves more conversations and enquiries into what others want and need for success. As we promote others, we may lose some of our (perceived) high profile visibility in the organization, which we accept in accordance with our new definition of personal success.</p></div><div id="Sec24" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Step 5</h4><p id="Par74" class="Para">Having completed Steps 1-4, we now have a sense of what we want and what it means to operate in this new meta-program. Step 5 is where we make a commitment to ourselves to try this for a period of time (Step 6). If for whatever reason we cannot make a full commitment (maybe we don’t want to give up that visibility or invest the time in others right now), then we stop here, or reset what we are willing to commit to as a trial change.</p></div><div id="Sec25" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Step <span id="ITerm37">6</span></h4><p id="Par75" class="Para">We try on the extreme other end of the meta-program, focusing solely on others and letting go of what we need or want as appropriate. We may spend a majority of our time reconnecting with our people and teams and engaging in active listening to understand and support them better. We consciously chose to let go of our habituated patterns and opinions and experience what it’s like to strongly focus our attention on others for a fixed period of time.</p><p id="Par76" class="Para">This step takes commitment and focus to complete. Our habits and the expectations of others may try to pull us back into our old ways of being. We have to want to change, to put the energy into change. Evolving ourselves as digital leaders and as humans comes down to making these shifts on a constant basis.</p><p id="Par77" class="Para">At the end of the trial period, we reflect on the experience in order to integrate it back into how we operate. Operating (even artificially like this) at the other extreme pulls our balance toward the middle as we exit this trial period, thereby introducing a more balanced and flexible nature to our meta-program.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">Of course how we operate and respond includes the logic, rules, and structure in our backend personality structures. Our meta-programs filter and adjust information flow and then call down into our backend to complete the response. We cover this in detail in the next chapter.</p></div></div></div><div id="Sec26" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Being an Introvert Is Not an Excuse for Having Poor Social Skills</h2><p id="Par79" class="Para">Many technologists are introverts, but it doesn’t mean that we have poor <span id="ITerm38">social skills</span>. Technologists are often labeled “nerds” by those around us. If we look at the dictionary definition of “nerd,” it actually calls out a lack of social skills:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par80" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“A person, especially a man, who is not attractive and is awkward or socially embarrassing.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par81" class="Para">— Cambridge Dictionary</p></blockquote><p id="Par82" class="Para">Being a nerd has nothing to do with being an introvert, and introversion has nothing to do with social skills. There are plenty of extremely social and successful people who are introverts. Introversion, as we identified early in this chapter, is one end of the Rejuvenation meta-program, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">9-6</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_9_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.48em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 9-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">Introversion on the <span id="ITerm39">Rejuvenation</span> meta-program</span></h6></div><p id="Par83" class="Para">Introversion indicates how we rejuvenate. Quite simply, when introverts are tired and drained, they will want to go somewhere quiet to relax to re-energize. An extrovert might want to find a bar with lots of people and energy to recharge and relax. Neither the extrovert nor the introvert is naturally gifted with good social skills. Sure, extroverts are often great talkers, but I’m sure we have all experienced those extroverts who talk too much! While being outwardly facing, their social skills can still leave something to be desired.</p><p id="Par84" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">It is my direct experience that technologists and some digital leaders use the (assumed) fact that they have no or poor social skills as an excuse to not build relationships with people in their organization, industry, and customers. Saying you have poor social skills is not an excuse for having poor social skills. Interacting with unfamiliar people may feel uncomfortable at first, and you may actually have less than average social skills (by some abstract definition of average). However, those skills, like any other, will not improve without work.</p><p id="Par85" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders don’t use their current social skill level as an excuse for not engaging with people. They embrace the opportunity to develop those skills because they want success and they know sustained success comes from growth.</p></div><div id="Sec27" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par86" class="Para">In this chapter we looked at how we represent external reality in our minds by processing information through our preferred communication channel(s) of VAKad and the meta-programs we run in our minds. A person’s preferred communication channel can significantly impact how effectively their communication is received, so it’s wise to strive to understand and communicate in their preferred channel.</p><p id="Par87" class="Para">There are a total of 60 meta-programs and each one consists of a spectrum with one or more points on that spectrum. We tend to face challenges in our leadership when we are “stuck” at one end of a meta-program.
