              <span id="ITerm1">Building a Great Tech Brand</span>
            </h2><p id="Par7" class="Para">There are numerous articles, books, and blog posts about what it takes to attract and retain the best technical talent. I’ve worked with a lot of organizations over my time in digital, in various roles from software engineer through to CTO, digital strategy consultant, and leadership development coach. During this time, I developed a list of seven elements that draw top talent to an organization, as demonstrated in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">15-1</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:22.65em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 15-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The seven <span id="ITerm2">elements of</span> <span id="ITerm3">building a great technology brand</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par8" class="Para">The seven elements are split into two distinct <span id="ITerm4">categories</span>:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par9" class="Para">The elements that are visible outside the organization, i.e., the company’s products and services.</p></li><li><p id="Par10" class="Para">The elements that are only visible inside the organization, i.e., the culture and people you work with</p></li></ul><p id="Par11" class="Para">Let’s take a look at the characteristics of the organization that are visible from outside.</p><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm5">Innovative and Interesting Products</span>
              </h3><p id="Par12" class="Para">As an external party, looking at the organization from the outside, our first exposure is to the products and services in market. If these are both interesting and innovative it draws talent in with a desire to work on them.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Impact on People, Industry, and /or <span id="ITerm6">Society</span></h3><p id="Par13" class="Para">It’s not enough for the products to be merely innovative and interesting, they have to be of use and have some level of impact on their users, industry or society. Without these latter elements, the products have novelty value only, which negatively impacts on the attractiveness of the organization.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm7">Commercial Sustainability</span>
              </h3><p id="Par14" class="Para">Equally, if the products aren’t commercially valuable and sustainable their longevity and that of the organization come into question.</p><p id="Par15" class="Para">With the first three elements in place, an interest in the organization develops. The best talent will likely investigate deeper into the internals of the organization in order to determine if it is somewhere they are passionate about and eager to join.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">The subsequent four (internal) elements of a great tech brand are defined as follows.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Working with <span id="ITerm8">Smart People</span></h3><p id="Par17" class="Para">When we work with smart people we learn, ideate, and create great products and it is one of the most enjoyable experiences we can have as technologists. Unfortunately, working with people at the other end of the spectrum can be extremely frustrating and demoralizing as we spend time trying to build capability and influence them.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Solving <span id="ITerm9">Big and Interesting Problems</span></h3><p id="Par18" class="Para">Big problems are fun to solve. Technologists like a challenge and they like to work on big and interesting challenges. Google, for example, has an obvious advantage due to their vast amounts of data, market position, scale, and funding. The problems Google can choose to focus on are likely to be bigger and more interesting than those of a small startup that does not have the same depth of data to work with.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Using <span id="ITerm10">Interesting Technology</span></h3><p id="Par19" class="Para">However, working with smart people and big problems can be really frustrating when the technology is old, unexciting, and generally not fit for purpose. We usually don’t get to choose all the technology in our stacks (and development pipeline). However, the more interesting and effective the technology, the more appealing the organization will be to work with.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Collaborative, Empowering, Contemporary <span id="ITerm11">Culture</span></h3><p id="Par20" class="Para">Great cultures are hard to define and take considerable time to explore in detail. I’m not going to do that here. What I will do is share what I see are the three main elements of an inspiring digital culture.
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par21" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">A collaborative culture,</em> where people work together and generally support each other, rather than contribute only as individuals striving for personal success</p></li><li><p id="Par22" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">An empowering culture</em> respects the autonomy of individuals and teams to solve the interesting challenges with interesting technologies</p></li><li><p id="Par23" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">A contemporary culture</em> is relaxed, friendly, and informal in nature. Contemporary cultures generally offer flexible hours, remote working, casual dress, and a pleasing working space and environment.</p></li></ul><p id="Par24" class="Para">These seven elements act like multipliers to the attractiveness of an organization as follows:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone" id="List3"><li><p id="Par25" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Attractiveness</strong> = (1) × (2) × (3) × (4) × (5) × (6) × (7).</p></li></ul><p id="Par26" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm12">attractiveness of</span> an organization reduces to zero if any element is zero. The higher the value of each element, the more attractive the organization. Therefore, any organization that manages to achieve high scores in all seven of these elements will be in a world-class position and have the ability to pick and choose talent from the global stage.</p><p id="Par27" class="Para">Of course, what makes each element attractive or not is subjective and dictated by the candidate’s desires and worldview. Each individual candidate will prioritize the seven elements in different ways depending on their current and desired status.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para">I’ve left the subject of financial reward out this conversation as I have made the assumption that you and your organization are offering competitive market rates. Financial incentives are less important to a candidate who is considering a role with a great technology brand. Offering great financial rewards does not compensate for a poor tech brand. You may be able to attract talent, but the likelihood of building a high-performance capability and sustaining it over time is exceedingly low.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">As leaders, we must do our best to grow all seven elements to enable us to build a sustainable and enjoyable organization.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Where Should We Focus Our <span id="ITerm13">Attention</span> When Growing Our Teams?</h2><p id="Par30" class="Para">Now that we have a shared understanding of how a great technology brand attracts and retains the best talent, let’s take a look at where we can focus our attention to grow the individuals in our organization. There are four distinct stages of an individual’s employment that we can leverage in order to best grow an individual and our organization.</p><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm14">1. Hiring</span>
              </h3><p id="Par31" class="Para">The first stage is the interview and selection process. Here we begin our relationship with the candidate as both parties assess the role and cultural fit of the candidate. Upon acceptance of an offer of employment, the individual moves to Stage 2—Onboarding.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm15">2. Onboarding</span>
              </h3><p id="Par32" class="Para">The candidate accepts our offer of employment and joins the organization. The onboarding process begins before the candidate’s first day in the office and continues for a number of weeks. Onboarding is essential to setting the right impression with the candidate, establishing an effective working relationship, and ensuring that they have everything they need for success.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm16">3. Growth and Execution</span>
              </h3><p id="Par33" class="Para">Once onboard, Stage 3 of the employee’s time with the organization is fulfilling and executing their role. Here we focus a majority of our attention on the growth of the employee and support them in contributing toward the organization’s objectives. At some point, an employee may proceed to Stage 4 and leave the organization</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">4. Exit</h3><p id="Par34" class="Para">When an employee exits the organization, we have an opportunity to gain explicit and valuable feedback regarding their experience of the organization and their motivators to leave and, potentially, which of the seven elements of a great tech brand they think their new organization has, that our organization doesn’t. How we deal with an employee’s exit has a significant impact on the people remaining in the organization. A positive and constructive exit that ends on a high demonstrates our genuine care for our people. A negative exit often begins with the leader ignoring the employee immediately following their resignation and poor treatment of them during their notice period and after their exit. This poor treatment by the leader is witnessed by those who remain in the leader’s teams and can cause them to question the leaders care for them.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Two Phases of Team Attention</h2><p id="Par35" class="Para">For us to excel at all four of these stages and truly grow our team members, it’s critical that we leverage the Human as a Full Stack model in order to a get a deep understanding of the individual. This allows us to connect with and grow them to exceptional levels and drive the high performance of the organization.</p><p id="Par36" class="Para">The Human as a Full Stack model is applicable at all four stages. Rather than describe its application (and other tools) at each of the four stages, I prefer to group the stages together into two key phases (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">15-2</a></span>) of attention: obtaining a deep understanding of the individual (the primary focus of the hiring and onboarding touchpoints) and coaching and supporting them (through the growth and execution phase).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_15_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_15_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.2em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 15-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The two <span id="ITerm17">phases of</span> team attention</span></h6></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Deep Understanding of the Individual</h3><p id="Par37" class="Para">The understanding and <span id="ITerm18">care</span> that Unnatural Leaders have for their people is holistic. We include and appreciate all aspects of an individual: their background, experiences, and the skills that they bring to the team and the organization. We include the whole person in our understanding, not just the “professional” person we see in the office. That is, we don’t consider the individual solely for the contribution they make as part of their role—we acknowledge their life and the dynamic that exists outside the office, which allows us to also respect an individuals needs, such as caring for children or family members.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">During the <span id="ITerm19">candidate’s hiring process</span>, most managers utilize the interviews to assess the candidate’s skill and experience <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">but</em> Unnatural Leaders also determine how their Human Full Stack is configured. The Human Full Stack provides an invaluable tool to determine the suitability of the candidate—how they are motivated, how they communicate, and their team and cultural fit.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">If you are hiring a leader for your organization, it is extremely valuable to assess their developmental stage (e.g., Early Expert through Late Achiever). Understanding the candidate’s stage (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>) gives us insight into how they may lead or manage their teams and whether their focus is primarily on competence (Expert) or outcomes (Achiever).</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">When Unnatural leaders transition from the hiring to the onboarding process, we switch from trying to predict the candidate’s Full Stack configuration to one of co-developing this deep understanding with the employee. Sadly, this is often the first experience the employee has of a leader paying real care and attention to their growth. All too often, busy leaders pay lip service to the onboarding process, offering a tour of the office and maybe even a t-shirt!</p><div id="Sec16" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Establish Effective Communication Patterns</h4><p id="Par41" class="Para">Establishing <span id="ITerm20">effective communications</span> with our new hire is critical to building a meaningful and productive relationship. The senior leaders I interviewed achieved this by explaining early on their preferred way to lead and communicate and establishing a level of interaction that works for both parties.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">It is our responsibility, as leaders, to ensure that we communicate effectively with our people, and this doesn’t mean that everyone must conform to our preferred channels and style. For really effective and clear communication, we have to modify our style to accommodate the preferences of those receiving our message.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span>, we explored the frontend communication channel of the Human Full Stack, which identified the different representational systems of VAKAd. Communicating in the other person’s preferred channel is essential for the message to be received as we intend. The Cognitive Scale meta-program (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>) is another important element of communication. One of the biggest frustrations I witness from both leaders and their people is when the two parties are at opposite ends of this meta-program. That is, one party is at the global, big picture end of the spectrum and the other party is at the fine detail end. Discussing this meta-program and our preferred styles can dramatically improve the effectiveness of communication in both directions.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par44" class="Para">If you are a leader with a preference for details, be warned. Your style can easily come across to your people as micro-management.</p></div></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Co-Create Their Profile</h4><p id="Par45" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders continuously develop their deep understanding of their team members by co-creating and maintaining a Human Full Stack profile of each employee. Together with the communication style preferences, leaders are able to broaden their understanding of the key meta-programs, values, beliefs, and Enneagram types of their team members in order to challenge, support, and grow their team members in the most effective ways.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para"><span id="ITerm21">Co-creation</span> is a critical part of the leader and employee journey. Sharing and discovering the elements of both party’s Human Full Stack is not only valuable for communication but will often be extremely engaging and enlightening for the employees, as they gain a deeper understanding of themselves and how they operate.</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">To give you an idea of how to do this, I’ll outline the approach I use when co-creating a new employee’s Full Stack. First, I start with a one-on-one session to introduce the concepts and share my own Full Stack. During this phase, I clarify my intentions (to grow and support them as an individual) and I explain the process and frameworks I use to develop a deeper understanding of them. We then take a break and I give the individual a questionnaire to complete, which they bring to our next session to discuss. The questionnaire is designed to make them think hard about what they want (and why they want it) and get them thinking about the frames they may hold about their role. We then use these insights to co-create their personal growth plan.</p><div id="FPar2" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par48" class="Para">If you would like to a copy of this questionnaire to use with your teams, download it from <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="https://unnatural.io/link/b156"><span class="RefSource">
                        <span class="EmphasisFontCategoryNonProportional">https://unnatural.io/link/b156</span>
                      </span></a></span>.</p></div><p id="Par49" class="Para">When it comes to the backend of the Human Full Stack, I utilize one of the Enneagram assessment tools mentioned in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>. I spend time walking through their report with them, which allows us to validate their type and identify key elements that they strongly resonate with.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">At a later point in time, after the employee has settled into their team, I run the team through a group Enneagram session to allow the whole team to get a deeper understanding of each other, reducing inter-team member friction, and increasing engagement and productivity. Even if the team has done one or more Enneagram sessions before, sharing and reviewing our core drivers again is always valuable as it provides time to for the team to reflect on current events together. It is also often a refreshing and welcome break away from the detail of product delivery.</p><p id="Par51" class="Para">As an Unnatural Leader, we encourage the constant review and discussion of our experiences, motivators, and frustrations. We facilitate both individual and group sessions that expand our understanding of how each individual’s Human Full Stack is configured. In order to create highly positive experiences and evolve both ourselves and the members of our team, we use the insights generated from these processes to connect with people on a deeper and more meaningful level and to support and challenge them in the most effective ways.</p></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Co-Creating a <span id="ITerm22">Personal Growth Plan</span></h4><p id="Par52" class="Para">The purpose of the growth plan is to create intentionality and concrete goals that develop the individual—faster than they would without guidance and support. It provides a clear and concise, shared understanding of what the individual wants to achieve, aligned with the objectives of the organization.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para">What goes into each plan varies dramatically by individual. Not only does it vary from person to person, their plan evolves over time (we are, after all, building future Unnatural Leaders!).</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm23">T-shaped skills model</span> has been a popular model (popularized by the likes of IDEO<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a>) to represent a person’s skillset. The crossbar of the “T” represents their shallow breadth across a range of skills and expertise and the vertical bar of the “T” represents their deep skills in a particular area. More recently, Kent Beck presented the Paint Drip<a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a> model which is, I believe, a more appropriate model of the type of individuals we need in our organizations. In the Paint Drip model, Beck argues that individuals acquire a wide variety of skills at various depths. The broad brush stroke across the page represents the individual’s constant and curious exploration. Each paint drip that falls down the page represents a particular dive into a skill, some shallow and some deep, and changing over one’s career.</p><p id="Par57" class="Para">Paint Drip people are curious people. The broad exploratory stroke and its associated drips are the mark of an individual that is able to grow, and therefore is in a better position to continue to evolve faster than the pace of change. T-shaped people, by the model’s very definition are tied to a specific vertical development.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders are paint drip people and they grow paint drip people and teams.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">Creating a growth plan should, therefore, represent this Paint Drip metaphor. It includes curiosity, concrete goals and objectives, and a deeper development of a variety of skills.</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">How you structure the specific growth plans is down to you to decide with your people. The plans need to respect the team and organizational context.</p><p id="Par61" class="Para">The time frame of the growth plan is also down to you. I find that focusing on a 1-2 year horizon to be useful for a majority of circumstances. I recommend setting phased intentions for new employees, as shown in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">15-1</a></span>.</p><div id="Tab1" class="Table"><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 15-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Five Phases of a <span id="ITerm24">Growth Plan</span></span></h6><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p class="SimplePara">Phase</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">Intention</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">Time Frame</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Integrate</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Support and integrate the individual into the organization, team and role</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">First 30 days</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Productivity</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Focus on getting them productive within their team</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">3 months</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Stretch</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Develop them further to stretch and engage them in their role</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">6 months</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Impact</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Helping them to have a wider impact on the organization</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">12 months</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Next Role</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Building them into their next role</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">18-24 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="FPar3" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par62" class="Para">If you are looking for a way to align objectives across an organization, I suggest you try Objective and Key Results<a href="#Fn4" id="Fn4_source"><sup>4</sup></a> or (OKRs) and a tool such as Lattice<a href="#Fn5" id="Fn5_source"><sup>5</sup></a> to facilitate their management.</p></div></div></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm25">Coaching and Support</span>
              </h3><p id="Par65" class="Para">I’m not going to go into details of how to set goals and manage performance—there are numerous books and articles that dive deep into those subjects. What I am going to discuss is how to become a (better) coach in service of the growth of your individuals and teams.</p><p id="Par66" class="Para">Coaching is mostly about listening and occasionally asking powerful questions that shift the coachee’s awareness of a concept, situation, or worldview. These powerful questions assist the individual in their growth. One mark of a good coach is for the coachee to feel like it is them that has made the new realization and shift. When they make a realization and believe it, the shift is transformational and long-term. Coaching this way can be quite challenging for leaders who feel the need to have and provide all of the answers. However, we are not the expert of our employee’s mind, so we have to get out of their way and allow the individual to find the answers for themselves.</p><p id="Par67" class="Para">The two biggest <span id="ITerm26">challenges</span> that I see most leaders face when attempting to coach and support their people are:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List4"><li><p id="Par68" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                      <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Have one-on-ones that are status updates and not coaching sessions</em>
                    </p><p id="Par69" class="Para">Most <span id="ITerm27">leaders </span>tell me they are doing one-on-ones with their people. When I dig deeper, it’s disappointing to find out that these one-on-ones are almost always transactional status updates, which involve the leader communicating priorities and the latest updates, while the employee gives status updates on the projects they are working on. The best leaders have one-on-ones that involve personal conversations around growth and learning. The purpose of the meetings is for you (their leader) to spend some (mental) time in their shoes, to empathize with them, understand how they are going, what they are motivated and frustrated by, and what other influences are impacting their state and their ability to be productive and grow. I recommend that you hold “real” one-on-ones every 2-3 weeks with each direct report (at a minimum).</p></li><li><p id="Par70" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                      <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Talk more than listen</em>
                    </p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Too many leaders like to talk and talk. When you are talking, you aren’t listening. When you aren’t listening you aren’t learning. Don’t get me wrong; there are times to talk and times when you must talk, but when it comes to one-on-one coaching conversations, the goal is to really listen, not simply wait for a moment to interject with your opinions. Instead, sit and listen to the other person, and receive all their verbal and non-verbal communications without interjecting. Don’t be afraid of silence, it’s a powerful tool. If you are a leader who likes to talk, spend some time reflecting on why you like to talk, and what it means to you to talk and share things?</p></li></ul><p id="Par72" class="Para">Getting ourselves out of the way (and listening more) is one of the things that makes a great coach. It’s all too easy to bring our own values, beliefs, preferences, and worldviews to coaching sessions and make assumptions as to what the other person means. A great coach listens, listens, and listens and, when appropriate, tests their own understanding with questions in the form of:<span id="ITerm28">

These <span id="ITerm30">non-verbal clues</span> are opportunities for inquiry, and in my experience, if you can uncover the topics where there are strong emotional responses, they are the opportunities for true growth for the employee. This playback sounds something like this:</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">

              </h3><p id="Par91" class="Para">It is common and, indeed, often desirable for coaching scenarios to dive into subjects that are challenging and difficult. Breaking through these big challenges is what creates big evolutionary transformations in people. This can make some sessions deep, intense, and uncomfortable for the coachee—especially if they have a fixed mindset and/or a global and pessimistic meta-program configuration. With this configuration employees who receive “<span id="ITerm34">constructive feedback</span>” tend to take it personally and generalize the feedback across more elements of their life. They can become pessimistic about their chances of succeeding in the future. The best approach to take in these, and, indeed, all leadership coaching scenarios, is to focus on learning and how the individual can learn and grow from a situation.</p><p id="Par92" class="Para">Reframing failure is critical to the process of becoming an Unnatural Leader.
