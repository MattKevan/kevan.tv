Gaining a better understanding of ourselves, our team, our stakeholders, and our customers allows us to respond better, grow faster, influence more, and deliver more effectively.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">The chapters in Part II are based on a decade of my experience in coaching, psychology, NLP, Neurosemantics, Leadership Agility, and the Enneagram and over 20 years in digital. Understanding people is a passion of mine—this book and the Unnatural Selection framework is the integration of my experience in both digital and psychology.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">I’ve integrated these two worlds here in Part II and developed the Humans as a Full Stack model, which simplifies the behaviors of a person and makes them understandable to technologists by drawing the analogy to that of a full technical stack, with a frontend, an API layer, and a backend. By the end of Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>, you will have a significantly deeper understanding of how people develop over time, the impact of personality type on responses and behaviors, how we process and filter external information, and the impact these factors have on successful communication.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">It’s going to be epic!</p></div></div><div class="FootnoteSection BookFrontmatterFootnoteSection"><h1 class="Heading">Footnotes</h1><div class="Footnote" id="Fn1"><p id="Par15" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn1_source">1</a> </span>William M.
