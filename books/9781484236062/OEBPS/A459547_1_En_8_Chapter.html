              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Often attributed to Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p id="Par4" class="Para">Bob was the head of product development for a large insurance company. He had been in his role for six months having left a successful technology product company to tackle bigger challenges. Bob was a smart, talented technologist who had made the transition to leadership better than most. His empathy and soft-skills were far above average and he had an outstanding track record, having delivered a number of market-leading products over his career.</p><p id="Par5" class="Para">In his new role, Bob had managed to secure some significant new hires and build a really competent, technical team to start the product build. The team was co-located, cross-functional, and had all the tools and facilities they needed to build a great product.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">Initially, everything went well. Bob helped set the vision and constraints for the product and posed challenges for the team to solve. Secretly, Bob thought that this might be one of those unicorn product builds—the ones where the product-market fit looks great, funding and stakeholder support are secured, and the team is highly competent and engaged.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">Yes, you guessed it, there is a “but”. As the team entered their third month of iterations, it became obvious to Bob that progress wasn’t being made as fast as he had hoped. The deliveries just weren’t being made, with the team caught up in defining and building a technically excellent product. One of the rock-star developers he hired was becoming disruptive. He was forcing his opinions as fact on the more junior developers and shutting down their ideas and contributions almost instantly. Bob stepped in and had the difficult conversation with the developer about his behavior.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">As time went on, things didn’t improve. The team just didn’t seem to be paying attention to, or even care about, delivering on time. Bob tried a variety of techniques and interventions, including one-on-ones and a facilitated retrospective. He observed that the main challenge was prioritization—everything seemed valuable, every architectural aspect critical, and engineering practices were the team's sole focus and priority.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">This was an extremely technically competent team who had all that they needed to deliver but just didn’t seem to have an eye on performance and outcomes. This frustrated Bob immensely, as he just couldn’t understand these really smart, brilliant people. After all, when Bob was last in a product team, cutting code, he was very much outcome focused. His ability to write code and keep the team focused on deliverables is what got him his promotion.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">As time went on, the team continued to let deadlines slip, and Bob continued to get dragged into managing the weekly iterations. Over time, Bob's stakeholders began to lose confidence in him, and he began to burn out. Although Bob typically preferred a flat organization, Bob decided to bring in an Engineering Manager to lead the technical team. Although the extra layer of hierarchy allowed Bob to complete his other activities, the command and control style of the Engineering Manager meant the team’s culture and morale went from bad to worse. A few months later, the project was abandoned as attrition rate within the team peaked and delivery became impossible.</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">This scenario is all too common with product teams. What Bob hadn’t yet understood was that he had gone through a cognitive upgrade of his own Human Stack (his API and backend) that moved him from the Expert level of development to Achiever level and his team hadn’t. In this chapter we are going to look at levels of development and how they impact our performance, both as digital leaders and on the people in our teams.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Stages of Development</h2><p id="Par12" class="Para">It is important to understand these human stack upgrades because they radically affect how we process the world around us, our motivators, and how we interact with our fellow humans. While each upgrade is small and iterative in nature, developmental psychologists have grouped the upgrades into what are called stages of development. Our own developmental stage impacts the frames we use to make sense of the world around us. The developmental stages of the people on our teams directly impact productivity and the culture of the organization.</p><p id="Par13" class="Para">The numerous developmental psychologists who have studied and researched stages of development each produced models that identify the stages in different ways—some utilize names (Leadership Agility, Bill Joiner), some use colors (Integral Theory, Ken Wilber), others use orders (Theory of Adult Development, Robert Kegan). Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">8-1</a></span> shows the stages as identified and defined by Bill Joiner and his Leadership Agility model<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:30.08em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-1. </span><span class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm1">Stages of development</span> as outlined in <span id="ITerm2">Leadership Agility</span> by Bill Joiner</span></h6></div><p id="Par15" class="Para">Each stage is a major upgrade release of our Human Full Stack. If we consider the standard software delivery release terminology, it outlines release numbers using the following format: Major: Minor: Revision. So, mapping back to the stages, each stage is a major release. When we develop ourselves and make a cognitive shift from, say Expert to Achiever, we are completing a Major upgrade (i.e., from 5.x.x to 6.0.0). These upgrades happen over time with smaller developments being released along the way, just as we would move from a 5.8.0 release to a 5.9.0 release before the major release of 6.0.0.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">To understand stage development and the stages, let’s first take a look at the (easier to understand) childhood stages<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">When a child is born, she has little cognitive function compared to an adult. However, she quickly develops cognitive capacities and abilities that allow her to function and communicate (between the ages of 0 and 2). She develops her physical abilities such as color vision, the ability to sit upright, walk, and then talk. As her awareness levels progress and she develops the capacity of object permanence, the ability to visually see things that are not physically present. This is the <span id="ITerm3">Explorer stage</span>.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Around her second birthday she enters the <span id="ITerm4">Enthusiast</span> stage. This stage lasts until age 6 or 7. During this stage, she moves beyond her physical sense of self and experiences herself as emotionally separate from others. This stronger awarness of her physcial and emotional self gives rise to language where I, me, and mine are expressed with strength along with phrases that include “I want” or “mine”. The stage often becomes a battle of wills as the child easily expresses her will but can’t always get what she wants.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">She only has the capacity to see the world from the perspective of her own wants and needs, and she doesn’t yet have the ability to generate insights into herself, her actions, or the behaviors of others. Most parents recognize the early part of this stage as “the terrible twos,” when tantrums happen frequently.</p><p id="Par21" class="Para">As children progress through the Enthusiast stage, they develop the ability of representational thinking. Representational thinking allows us to integrate multiple sensory impressions of objects and categorize them (for example, cars and rockets). They also develop their basic understanding of time, from talking about what they might do tomorrow (around age 3), to what parents may have promised for them for their next birthday (around 4 years).</p><p id="Par22" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm5">Operator</span> stage is typical for the grade school years of life. Here the child develops concrete operations—the ability to think about specific properties of objects such as color, shape, and size. This ability allows them to distinguish between imagination and reality. Critically they also develop an ability to regulate their impulses as they anticipate the short-term impact of their actions.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm6">Conformer</span> stage starts around the ages of 11-12 for girls and usually a year later for boys. Conformers define themselves as part of a tribe or group and often lose their full sense of identity. The price to pay for being part of a group is loyalty and obedience, and as such, they accept norms and rules of the group without question or objection. They learn that to be part of a group, they need to be a likeable person who is “nice,” “good looking,” and “pleasant”. Their black and white thinking now shifts to an “us and them” (rather than I), but they still don’t have a sense of a separate adult identity.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">Most of us develop into the <span id="ITerm7">Expert</span> stage in high school and graduate university to join the workforce at this level. The earlier childhood stages are progressed through in a linear fashion for healthy children, usually advancing at a similar rate guided by the structured school environment. The adult stages, however, have no guaranteed progression—some of us live long lives and die elderly at the Expert stage, while others reach significantly higher stages in their early 20s or 30s.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm8">adult</span> stages become increasingly more complex to understand and far too deep to cover here. This book is about digital leadership, so I am going to focus on the key stages of the Leadership Agility framework. Leadership Agility takes the stages of development and identifies specific adult capacities required to lead in increasingly complex scenarios. Joiner defines and explains how leaders operate at each stage, and the specific capacities that require development, namely pivotal conversations, leading teams, and leading organizational change.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">8-2</a></span> outlines the five stages defined by the <span id="ITerm9">Leadership Agility framework</span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.78em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The five stages of the Leadership Agility <span id="ITerm10">framework</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par27" class="Para">The leadership development journey begins at the bottom, with the Expert stage, and moves one stage at a time. Joiner’s research identified that the majority of managers assessed were at the Expert or Achiever stages of development. The actual estimates of the distribution of leaders are 55% Expert, 35% Achiever, and 10% at Catalyst or later<a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a>. For this reason, I focus on the three levels—Expert, Achiever, and Catalyst—which make up more than 90% of the world’s leaders.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">The transition from one stage to the next occurs through reflective action. We perform actions, step back and reflect on the impact of the actions, and then adapt our approach. When we are ready to move to the next stage, we do this reflection with the new awareness and intent of the next stage.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">For example, when experts become frustrated with the sheer volume of knowledge, information, and data that they need to absorb for their role, they try to work longer and longer hours until they burn out. At this point, they take a step back and reflect on what they are doing. They usually realize that the more they know, the more there is to know, and they begin their progression to the Achiever stage, where information is prioritized based on outcomes and goals.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par31" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize, the less I know.</em>
                </p><p id="Par32" class="Para">—Often attributed to Michel Legrand</p></blockquote><p id="Par33" class="Para">The shift to each higher stage transcends and includes all earlier stages. A person at the <span id="ITerm11">Achiever</span> stage has full access to the frames, knowledge, and capacities of the Expert (and earlier) stages should it be required. When trying to understand what it means to transcend and include stages, it can help to think about the earlier childhood stages. It wouldn't be very productive if we developed the ability to walk and then lost it at the next stage of development, so we carry that knowledge with us through life.</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">Each subsequent stage provides a greater perspective on ourselves, others, and the challenges faced. Joiner uses the analogy of a camera and lens that is focused on a specific challenge. At the earlier stages, our lens is a fixed (say 50mm) lens, with a rigid, narrow perspective. The Expert stage then brings the first (limited) zoom lens to our mental camera, giving us a limited ability to zoom out and, when required, zoom back in to the scenario. Each stage adds more and more zoom capability, zooming out to say, a team challenge, then to the organizational context, then to market dynamics, and eventually a global context (and back again as needed). These broader perspectives on how we view the world also include the ability to see character traits, patterns, and structures of both ourselves and the people we interact with.</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">Try this exercise with me: Take your hands and position them together to create a viewing frame, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">8-3</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:18.55em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">Frame your view with your hands</span></h6></div><p id="Par36" class="Para">Now place them so that this book (or electronic view of this book) fills the entire frame (this will usually be around 15cm/6in from the book). This view is how we focus on a particular challenge. This limited, constrained view and perspective is akin to one of the early stages of development. All that is in focus and awareness is the book itself—the immediate problem we are trying to solve. If a page of the book fills more than our little frame of reference, we cannot be sure we are even looking at a book.</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">Now move your hands farther away, to about 1 meter/3 feet from the book. Our perspective now includes more of the book and its surroundings. We may be able to see a desk or table, a computer, maybe a coffee cup, and even a small portion of the room we are in. This higher stage gives us more context and information about the problem we are focusing on. We can now see more of the world and how it’s impacting our view of the book, and the other components that were always right there next to book (like a coffee cup), which we didn’t initially focus on.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">Now, release your hands and take in the whole view of the room you are in, while referring to the book and its location. We can now identify light sources, potentially other people in the room, or other rooms, etc. We now have a wide, “systems view” of the book. With this information available and held in our mind, we can then put our initial frame back in position and focus in on the book, holding an awareness of the room we just saw. This awareness of the bigger picture is developed as we advance through the stages of development.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">Coupled with the ability to zoom in and out and obtain broader perspectives, is our ability to comprehend time, both further into the future and back into the past. Early stages, such as Expert, can comprehend time beyond 1 year. But, as leaders, they find it most compelling to focus only up to 12 months ahead. As we progress to later stages, such as Achiever, we expand this focus to 3-5 years. Even later stages are capable of spanning hundreds or even thousands of years. This broader sense of time is critical for a digital leader in order to identify future trends and operate strategically.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Expert Stage</h2><p id="Par40" class="Para">Experts love solving problems. They work hard on problems and when the going gets tough, they work even harder. A common belief that experts hold is that the harder they look for (or refine) a solution, the better it will be. Experts love to demonstrate their competence, and they thrive on the recognition of their contribution to the solution.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">All knowledge is valuable and the acquisition of new knowledge and expertise is a key motivator for experts. As such, prioritization can become a challenge for many leaders at this stage of their development. In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Drive</em><a href="#Fn4" id="Fn4_source"><sup>4</sup></a>, Pink defines the three components of motivation as Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Mastery is a primary focus for those of us at the Expert stage.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">Experts have a primary style that is either assertive or accommodating. This style is determined by the individual's personality and flavors their interactions with others. Experts who have an assertive style exercise it more strongly and become more dominant if they feel like they have the authority or a higher-ranking role. Equally their assertiveness is reduced in scenarios where they believe they don't have authority.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">There are three areas of functionality that are upgraded with each Human Stack release that are of specific interest to digital leaders: Team Operation, Leadership, and Stakeholder Management. Let’s break these down from an expert’s perspective.</p><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Experts as <span id="ITerm12">Team Members</span></h3><p id="Par45" class="Para">Most technologists begin their career at the Expert stage of development, and as such most Product Development teams have a strong representation of experts.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">Experts usually find their own problem definitions and solutions the most compelling. Assertive experts tend to argue their position quite strongly. Their arguments can be forceful when they consider themselves to have authority. Experts with the accommodating style still find their solutions most compelling but will tend to defer to others (especially those with authority).</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">Their focus on mastery and problem solving can often leave achievers frustrated by their lack of outcome and delivery focus. This is amplified by their shorter term, tactical focus, ranging from the present day to around 12 months into the future. For some team members, mastering the technology and/or mastering the delivery process can be more important than achieving customer-oriented outcomes (an achiever’s aspiration).</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Expert <span id="ITerm13">Leadership</span></h3><p id="Par48" class="Para">Experts implicitly assume that leadership is about expertise and authority. They assume great leaders have deep knowledge of their field and enjoy people seeking them out to provide answers to tough challenges. This is validated when they are promoted into leadership roles having demonstrated expertise in their field.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">When an expert is looking for (or being offered) advice, they will first look to the credibility and authority of the source (qualifications, recognized expert in the field, etc.), dismissing anyone who doesn’t meet their own criteria of being an expert.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">An expert leader <span id="ITerm14">operates</span> more tactically and their focus is usually only on the teams and areas of the organization under their direct authority. Their strong problem-solving orientation leads them to solving specific challenges, often missing broader innovation opportunities. Experts prefer an individual one-on-one approach when leading, as opposed to developing a team of direct reports. The one-on-one interactions give them finer grained control of the individuals involved and maintain their own deep understanding of the work being completed. In essence, experts have not yet developed the capacity to think in systems and apply that thinking to their team or businesses.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Expert <span id="ITerm15">Stakeholder Management</span></h3><p id="Par51" class="Para">Stakeholders are generally dealt with by experts on an “as needed” basis, often focused on one or two key stakeholders who may assist or impede their current initiative’s success. In essence, the Expert stage stakeholder management is mostly considered a necessary “political evil” to get the job done.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">The style and approach they take with stakeholders depends on whether they believe they have authority over the stakeholder or not and whether their natural style is assertive or accommodating. Experts often use a more assertive style when they believe they have authority, and switch to a more passive style when they are subordinate to the stakeholder.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Expert to <span id="ITerm16">Achiever Transition</span></h3><p id="Par53" class="Para">The transition from expert to achiever is often brought about by frustration with acquiring, what seems like, an endless amount of detailed domain and product knowledge. Often this frustration results in a buildup of stress, fatigue, and in some cases burnout. This stress pushes the individuals to question their current mode of operation and the personal cost of valuing expertise so highly. This is akin to the number of defects in the technical stack becoming unmanageable and requiring a major release of functionality or a rewrite to address the suboptimal way the API layer and backend are processing the world.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">As <span id="ITerm17">experts reflect</span> on their operation (and burnout), their further developed reflective thinking fuels their ability for strategic and systems thinking and promotes an increased awareness of individual subjectivity. Experts shift from doing a task well to achieving outcomes valued by the larger organization. This transition to achiever gives them the ability to prioritize information using concepts such as the Pareto Principle (or 80/20 rule), where 80% of the value comes from 20% of the work or effort.</p></div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Achiever Stage</h2><p id="Par55" class="Para">Achievers are goal oriented and focus their energy on achieving outcomes rather than gaining expertise in specific areas. Strategy and strategic operation are core to the Achiever stage of development, as such achievers spend a lot of their time working out strategies for success. The drive toward success and achievement at this stage is motivated by rewards and recognition. The rewards can be either monetary or status-based (public recognition or promotion); therefore role titles are usually important for achievers. At this stage, leaders also begin to understand the individual character traits of those around them and predict the basic behaviors of their team and stakeholders. Achievers see understanding behaviors as valuable and apply this idea to themselves. They are then able to modify their own behaviors to reach their goals. Unlike experts, achievers are aware that leadership is about motivating others and they associate the behaviors of others with their underlying motivations, rather than character traits of a person.</p><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Achievers as <span id="ITerm18">Team Members</span></h3><p id="Par56" class="Para">Achievers in teams love to identify and set team goals and develop processes and strategies to enable the team to achieve their outcomes. Achievers focus on processes that often contain metrics and measures (such as velocity and burn-down charts) to visibly track progress toward an objective.</p><p id="Par57" class="Para">Achievers can sometimes demonstrate competitive behaviors (both intra-team and inter-team) in order to reach their personal goals.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Achiever Leadership</h3><p id="Par58" class="Para">Achievers believe <span id="ITerm19">leadership</span> is about creating challenging and satisfying environments to enable people to contribute to larger organizational objectives. They develop and orchestrate effective teams and deliver against clearly defined goals and strategies. The culture and strategy they develop is customer-centric, with clear rewards and recognition schemes driven by customer outcomes. When under pressure and faced with a choice of delivery or culture, the achievers usually default to delivery in favor of shorter-term wins.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">The development from expert to achiever (and the associated shift to outcome-focused behaviors) usually sees Achiever stage leaders bring on a higher capacity for strategy and culture than the more tactical, delivery-focus of the expert. Teams reporting to an achiever are led as a system, facilitated toward outcomes and measured by results.</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">Under stress however, achiever leaders can regress back to an expert mode of operation, jumping into problem solving mode and micro-managing their teams. We often see this regression to detailed, controlling behavior with tech startup founders. It’s what I call “founder’s syndrome”.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Achiever <span id="ITerm20">Stakeholder Management</span></h3><p id="Par61" class="Para">Achievers tend to see influence as central to leadership rather than authority. They figure out ways to get things done, sometimes outside usual authority relationships, by creating relationships with people that enable their success (i.e., key stakeholders). The upgrade to achiever sees a shift in power style, toward a more balanced approach that is both assertive and accommodating. They will often exhibit both approach during the same meeting.</p><p id="Par62" class="Para">Achievers develop an initial sense of empathy and understanding that is applied to the way they interact with stakeholders. They pay much more attention to building longer-term relationships with stakeholders than experts do. However, achievers still focus mainly on the relationships that they believe will give them short- to medium-term success.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Achiever to <span id="ITerm21">Catalyst Transition</span></h3><p id="Par63" class="Para">Early on, achievers chase goals and high performance. However, the achiever’s developed reflective capacity leads them to realize some of the limiting behaviors that are holding them back from being successful. This realization is combined with a desire to find deeper meaning in what they do and how they lead others and begins their development to the Catalyst stage.</p></div></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Catalyst Stage</h2><p id="Par64" class="Para">Catalysts develop a broader and more long-term view of their organization and, as such, are more comfortable with change and uncertainty. As with every stage transition, catalysts transcend and include the behaviors exhibited at the Achiever and Expert stage, allowing them to remain outcome focused. However, their attention is now placed strongly on the larger dynamic of human interactions and relationships. Where the achiever’s intent was to achieve outcomes, the catalyst desires to create meaningful and satisfying experiences that enable sustainable delivery of outcomes over time. Catalysts appreciate the richness of human life and respect each individual’s perspective and journey.</p><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Catalysts as <span id="ITerm22">Team Members</span></h3><p id="Par65" class="Para">Fully developed catalysts are able to access expert, achiever, and catalyst mindsets and behaviors. In a team dynamic, they utilize these abilities to focus on growing and developing teams and nurturing relationships across the wider organization. They often provide a balanced, less emotional response under pressure and will question their own assumptions to understand the motivations of others. Catalysts understand that they do not have (and cannot have) all the answers to all the problems.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Catalyst Leadership</h3><p id="Par66" class="Para">Catalyst stage <span id="ITerm23">leadership</span> is visionary and facilitative. They create new environments and contexts where people can creatively develop solutions that benefit multiple stakeholders. Catalyst leadership is the first stage of what is called “post-heroic” leadership—where the primary driver for the leader is in enabling the success of others (rather than their own). Catalysts utilize participative decision making in the teams they lead, sometimes seeking out multiple opinions and striving for consensus as they fully integrate the value each individual contributes.</p><p id="Par67" class="Para">Like achievers, catalysts create visions and strategies that deliver over short- to long-term horizons. However, unlike achievers, catalysts appreciate the unpredictable nature of the future and set out to build organizations that are Agile in nature and are able to sense and respond to disruptive developments that are not possible to predict.</p><p id="Par68" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Catalyst leaders are the first stage of leaders that embody the attributes required for Unnatural Leaders, with the potential to evolve themselves and their organizations faster than the pace of change.</em>

They excel at stakeholder management by understanding humans and the importance of maintaining long-term relationships that generate mutually beneficial outcomes across the organization as a whole.</p><p id="Par70" class="Para">Like achievers, they seek out stakeholders across team boundaries for feedback and contribution, but they also include those stakeholders who are considered difficult and prickly to deal with. When engaging with stakeholders, catalysts can actively balance different styles, both supporting their own perspectives while also enquiring about others.</p></div></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">So What Does All This Mean?</h2><p id="Par71" class="Para">As you read through the descriptions of the three stages of development—Expert, Achiever, and Catalyst—you may have noticed that the achiever most resembles the espoused view of leadership and management in today’s workplace. Our western, Wall Street view of business is certainly one of Achiever stage views: a system designed on meritocracy, status, and financial results. The process of starting up a business, growth hacking, and doing an <span id="ITerm25">Initial Public Offering (IPO)</span> to the stock market is a classic Achiever stage process that is financially rewarding for those leaders who make it. The challenge with this system is that the cost of success is often paid by employees working long hours for average pay, affecting their health and well-being and with little to no positive social or environmental impact. Put simply, it is often driven by ego and greed, at any expense. (It should be noted that there are individuals who are at the Achiever stage of development and have a set of personal values and beliefs that they prioritize over defined outcomes that will not allow them to participate in this system. Instead, they are often found leading in non-profit or charity organizations.)</p><p id="Par72" class="Para">When we look at disruption, change, and innovation and the need to evolve faster than the pace of change, what we are essentially talking about is evolving our capacities through this stage. The further we progress through these stages, the broader our perspective. Our attention shifts to people, rather than the technology, process, or personal outcome. We become more self-aware of our personality, assumptions, and biases.</p><p id="Par73" class="Para">The catalyst’s ability to look further into the future (and past) and to appreciate the unpredictable nature of the future and create organizations that evolve through sensing and responding to disruption, put the catalyst in a very strong position to build teams and people (including themselves) that evolve faster than the pace of change. These organizations are based on genuine cultures of empowerment and collaborative problem solving as modeled by the leaders themselves.</p><p id="Par74" class="Para">Joiner’s research identified that the majority of managers assessed were at the Expert or Achiever stages of development. We can safely assume that the majority of leaders that we come into contact with on a daily basis (and indeed ourselves) are likely to be at the Expert or Achiever stage of development.</p><p id="Par75" class="Para">This is of grave concern given that the connected nature of devices, systems, organizations, and people is accelerating at an exponential rate. This interdependence brings with it a significant added complexity that requires a broader and higher stage of awareness to succeed.</p><p id="Par76" class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">8-4</a></span> shows Joiner’s research and how each level is positioned to be consistently effective as the pace of change and interdependence increase.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:26.78em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">Reproduced with permission of ChangeWise, Inc.</span></h6></div><p id="Par77" class="Para">Irrespective of your own leadership capacity, developmental stages provide valuable insights into managing our teams and show why some teams struggle with delivery and culture more than others. A team of Expert stage thinkers is generally going to struggle with delivering strategically, and therefore requires help and guidance from you as a leader to expand its perspective on the business environment and its capacity to look into the future.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">Longer term strategic thinking, envisioning, and direction setting is more developed at the Achiever stage (or above). Achiever stage leaders use these capacities to guide and shape the future for those who haven’t yet developed the ability to conceptualize far enough into the future or find those future focused goals compelling enough to drive their actions.</p><p id="Par79" class="Para">All too often we mistake a person’s inability to focus strategically on the future as a lack of intelligence and therefore as fixed. It is not. It is merely a stage of development and therefore something that can be learned through coaching and training. If we apply stages of development to the Digital Situational Leadership model (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">8-5</a></span>), it should be obvious that the later stages are more easily able to balance the Tactical/Strategic and Delivery/Culture aspects and push the boundaries of the strategic and cultural components.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="height:32.72em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-5. </span><span class="SimplePara">

Nine out 10 people believe they are above average when it comes to their personal looks—obviously, this cannot be true. Something similar happens when we ask leaders to assess their leadership abilities and skill level—around a third rate themselves the same as others, a third below others, and a third above. Therefore, we can assume that only one in three has a reasonable understanding of their leadership abilities.</p><p id="Par81" class="Para">There are two factors that influence leaders to rate themselves at a higher stage than they are:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par82" class="Para">A desire to simply be at the top of the ladder: The developmental stages look like a ladder and we’ve spent some time talking about how the later stages of development are better positioned to deal with disruption and more complex challenges. Therefore, there is an aspirational aspect for most leaders. This aspiration is amplified at the Achiever stage.</p></li><li><p id="Par83" class="Para">Understanding the concepts of the higher stages doesn’t mean we behave and lead that way. Simply understanding the higher stages doesn’t mean that we have embodied the deeper and broader capacities of the later stages. Understanding and aspiring to be higher doesn’t mean that we are there (yet).</p></li></ul><p id="Par84" class="Para">So, how do we go about making a sound and accurate assessment of our stage? I use the Leadership Agility 360 assessment<a href="#Fn5" id="Fn5_source"><sup>5</sup></a> which, like other 360-degree assessments, surveys the people around us—our teams, our bosses, and our stakeholders. The assessment then reports the stage that we personally believe we are at and the stage that others experience us as being at. This gives us the ability to gain valuable feedback and reflect on how effective we are with each group.</p><p id="Par86" class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">8-6</a></span> shows a small sample of the full report that is generated by the Leadership Agility 360 assessment. Across the top row, we have the three stages of Leadership Agility—Expert, Achiever, and Catalyst—and two intermediate, transition stages—Expert/Achiever and Achiever/Catalyst (which provide a little more granularity for the report). We then have four diamond shaped markers that denote the ratings—Self, Primary Manager, Direct Reports, and Key Stakeholders—and a black circle for all others.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_8_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:6.38em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 8-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">A sample Leadership Agility 360 summary report</span></h6></div><p id="Par87" class="Para">We can see from this one small <span id="ITerm28">section</span> of the report that this particular leader is a late-stage achiever and beginning to make a transition into catalyst. The leader has also rated herself higher than everyone else.</p></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Accelerating Our Development to Higher <span id="ITerm29">Stages</span></h2><p id="Par88" class="Para">It should also be acknowledged that higher stages of development aren’t any better than the lower stages in terms of happiness or hierarchy. They simply have more capacity. The increased capacity solves the lower stage challenges we face, such as responding emotionally and assuming our opinions are fact. However, it replaces them with more complicated systemic challenges that span far wider timelines.</p><p id="Par89" class="Para">That said, each increased stage brings with it an increased capacity for complexity, collaboration, and tackling larger and larger problems. The shift from expert to achiever is essential to basic leadership. The shift from achiever to catalyst brings capacities that position us well to solve global, cross-organizational challenges, and have a positive social impact.</p><p id="Par90" class="Para">So the question on most leaders’ minds is: How do I move to a higher stage more quickly?</p><p id="Par91" class="Para">There are two ways you can <span id="ITerm30">accelerate</span> your development: this book is the first. Becoming aware that there are stages of development and what stage you are currently at is critical. By reading this book and reflecting on your teams around you, your awareness has already shifted significantly.</p><p id="Par92" class="Para">This awareness and a desire to change can drive you to the second tool to accelerate development—engaging a coach. The right coach operates from a stage higher than our own. They use their wider perspective and view of reality to help expand our own awareness. They do this during coaching sessions by asking powerful questions that cause us to question or see our limited worldview. A great coach doesn’t provide answers; they guide us to our development.</p></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par93" class="Para">In this chapter we looked at the various upgrades we undergo as our adult development progresses. We identified three key Leadership Agility stages—Expert, Achiever, and Catalyst—and covered how they affect the way we operate in teams, as leaders, and with stakeholders.</p><p id="Par94" class="Para">We discussed how leadership requires the Achiever stage (or later stage) operation for high performance. The key challenge we face as leaders is dealing with teams at the Expert stage of development.</p><p id="Par95" class="Para">In our introductory scenario, Bob identified that his team couldn’t prioritize and that they were focused on technical excellence (or mastery). Once Bob understands that this is a developmental stage for his team, he can make informed decisions on how to solve the problem. His solution options include getting more involved with the team and providing the prioritization required or hiring new team members who are at the Achiever stage and providing training and tools to assist them in their prioritization of their work.</p><p id="Par96" class="Para">As an achiever, Bob also needs to focus on his own development if he is going to thrive amidst the change and complexity that is ever increasing. As an aspiration, Bob (and indeed anyone else at expert or achiever) would be well placed to develop an “upgrade” of himself to catalyst.</p><p id="Par97" class="Para">These upgrades to our API layer, microservices, and backend software happen in small increments until we reach the next stage or a major release. In the next chapter, we are going to look a closer look at our API and microservices layer and how these can help accelerate our development and evolution.</p></div><div id="Sec20" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Self-Reflection Questions</h2><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List2"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par99" class="Para">What stage do you believe you currently operate at?
