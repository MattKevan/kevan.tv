There are currently around 7 billion people on the planet. 7 billion individuals, all with a unique set of values, beliefs, opinions, preferences, memories, and biases. Not only is that number significant, the human personality and mind is also incredibly complex, making it virtually impossible to accurately predict and understand even one or two people.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">The good news is we don’t need to. To be an Unnatural Leader, we simply have to know enough about people and personalities to stay ahead. Investing time in understanding psychology and how our brains work, significantly impacts our leadership performance. In true Agile fashion, we focus on developing the most valuable skills and understanding first, and wherever possible, find hacks to short circuit the learning effort.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para"><span id="ITerm1">Humans as a Full Stack</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">7-1</a></span>) is one such hack. I developed this model to easily explain the human internal processing, which is analogous to a full technology stack. So let’s take a look and see how easy it can be to “hack the stack”.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:33.75em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 7-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">Humans as a Full Stack model</span></h6></div><p id="Par8" class="Para">Let’s first look at the components of the technology stack (the left side) before we explain how it applies to humans (the right side).</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm2">Frontend</span>
            </h2><p id="Par9" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm3">frontend</span> is how the users interact with the app, through a visual, audible, or physical user interface (UI). The UI is designed in alignment with an intended (or all-too-often unintended) user experience (UX) and is the mechanism that users see, hear, touch, feel, or even smell. Users interact through a specific device—a laptop, desktop, mobile, or wearable—where each has a customized experience offering, and in some instances dramatically different functionality. In early release products, the experiences often focus on one particular device, leaving others unused or reduced in functionality (i.e., mobile-first offerings) until the product-market fit is validated. An example frontend is a browser-based, online banking web app.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">API and <span id="ITerm4">Microservices Layer</span><span id="ITerm5">
                
                
              </span></h2><p id="Par10" class="Para">In a well architected technical product, the core logic is abstracted away from the frontend implementation and accessed through an <span id="ITerm6">application programming interface (API) layer</span>. The <span id="ITerm7">API layer</span> usually provides a range of services, including load balancing, security, and orchestration of the request to an appropriate microservice. The microservice encapsulates a discrete unit of functionality that accepts a request, processes it, and responds. Often these services will communicate and request data from a backend system, and in some situations translate communication protocols suitable for the backend. In the banking example, services for balance retrieval, transactions, and depositing funds are commonplace.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Backend</h2><p id="Par11" class="Para"><span id="ITerm8">Backend systems</span><span id="ITerm9">
                
                
              </span> range from simple data stores to complex (and sometimes legacy) mainframe systems. They often contain considerable business logic and troublesome state management, which heavily utilizes a persistent data store. Banking backends are often mainframe based and responsible for storing customer banking information and records, and they often integrate with the national and international banking systems.</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">This stack is definitely not a contemporary serverless one. It is more akin to what you might find in most large enterprises today. But this conversation isn’t about tech stacks, as enjoyable as they are. Let’s progress and talk about the human analogy.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm10">Human Frontend</span>
            </h2><p id="Par13" class="Para">When interacting with someone, the human frontend is what you see and hear (and potentially feel and smell) during the interaction. It’s how they present themselves in dress choices (their UI) and how they speak, move, and respond to your interactions with them (their UX). A person’s neurology (their five senses) captures information and requests from the world and then converts that into electrical systems ready for the brain to process.</p><p id="Par14" class="Para">The more we know and understand the person we’re interacting with, the more predictable their response will be. This is, after all, the end game for us! If we can predict their response (or a narrow set of possible responses), we can design our interactions to generate the response we are hoping for.</p><p id="Par15" class="Para">Like a tech frontend, humans have a preferred, or “more functional,” communication channel. Some people are naturally wired to be more visual, preferring to see, draw, and visualize information. Some prefer auditory; they like to talk and listen and are often highly conversational in nature. Others are kinesthetic, where movement is key element of their communication style.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">The key here is to know that if you are trying to communicate with someone on their less preferred channel, your effectiveness will be drastically reduced. I personally am wired for visual communications; I find it difficult to remember details that I am given verbally. For example, if someone tells me the pin combination to a door, I will often forget it quite quickly. However, if I write it down and see the code, I find I remember it significantly longer, sometimes years later. Understanding and conceptualizing new ideas and solutions amplifies this difference.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">Great communications combine visual and auditory information to ensure the best impact when dealing with numerous people simultaneously, say in a meeting or presentation.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">Once a frontend interaction has been initiated, the request is passed to the equivalent of the API layer.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm11">Human API and Microservices Layer</span>
            </h2><p id="Par19" class="Para">Once we receive a message, our brains filter, distort, delete and generalize the information and call into our meta-programs for processing. As I’ve mentioned, our neurology is bombarded with over 2 million bits of information a second. We don’t have the capacity to process all this information consciously, so our brains filter it based on our values, beliefs, preferences, intent, and mindset. Let’s dive deeper into three of these filters: distortions, deletions, and generalizations.</p><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm12">Distortions</span>
              </h3><p id="Par20" class="Para">Distortions are when we distort an external event and make it less impactful (smaller) or more significant (larger) than it actually is. Maybe someone paid us a small compliment, which we distort into something grander because it makes us feel good and gives us a positive feeling. Alternatively, we might receive feedback that we then distort negatively into personal criticism. Distortions are analogous to the API layer prioritizing certain requests to the services.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm13">Deletions</span>
              </h3><p id="Par21" class="Para">Deletion is the process by which we subconsciously remove “unnecessary” information from our consciousness. Consider the cars on the road that you never notice until you start looking at a model to purchase and then you see them everywhere! Deletions can be subtler in nature; for example, we may delete a compliment from a person. Maybe we don’t think they are being genuine or maybe we believe we aren’t worthy of the compliment.</p><p id="Par22" class="Para">Deletions allow our brains to operate effectively. Without deletions, we would need to process all input received into our senses, which would simply overload our ability to operate and think with any level of clarity. Human deletions are similar to the API layer denying unauthorized access to services. The request for the service comes into the API layer (or brain) and is deleted or blocked from being processed.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm14">Generalizations</span>
              </h3><p id="Par23" class="Para"><span id="ITerm15">Generalizations</span> allow us to process and communicate efficiently. All nouns in language are generalizations. Banana describes a fruit, which is a food, a sweet food, green to yellow in color, and safe to eat. Banana says all those things, in one simple word. It generalizes all bananas and their descriptions. Without generalizations, it would take considerable effort to process the external world, let alone communicate with others.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">We also develop our generalizations through the experiences we have. If, for instance, we take two vacations in New York city and it rains both times, we might generalize and say “it always rains in New York”. Generalizations usually develop after multiple similar experiences. They can, however, develop after just one sufficiently intense experience.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">We can hear a person’s generalizations when they talk, and we can read them when they write. When generalizing, a person may use words such as “always,” “never,” “customers,” “developers,” and even “leadership” as generalizations.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par26" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">All generalizations are false, including this one.</em>
                  </p><p id="Par27" class="Para">—Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p id="Par28" class="Para">In the tech stack, generalizations are akin to the system batching up similar frontend requests and providing a single response.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">The challenges with all three of these filters are the blind spots they create in service of efficiency. For example, confirmation bias is a phenomenon that stems from distortions, deletions, and generalizations and significantly impacts our leadership ability. Awareness, at its essence, includes becoming aware of the filters that we and others are using.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">We now know how deletions, generalizations, and distortions work to filter information from our frontend to our brains. Let’s next look at how meta-programs process and translate information in our brains.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm16">Meta-Programs</span>
                <span id="ITerm17">
                  
                  
                </span>
              </h3><p id="Par31" class="Para">Meta-programs act as perceptual filters as we attempt to create an internal representation of reality in our minds. Each meta-program is specified as a continuum, with poles at either end. Each pole describes a preference for processing reality. One of the simplest meta-programs to understand is the Cognitive Scale meta-program (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">7-2</a></span>), which i will use to explain how meta-programs work.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.73em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 7-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">Cognitive Scale meta-program</span></h6></div><p id="Par32" class="Para">The Cognitive Scale meta-program determines how a person prefers to think about and process the world, either through the big picture (global) or through finer details (detail). “Big picture thinkers” are often irritated by, and tend to ignore, the details in any given situation. People with global tendencies usually write in bullet points and use generalized language. When offered details, they often interrupt and ask for context or a higher-level systemic view of the situation. People with a preference for detail write lengthy documents and emails, can be very specific when sharing information, and often ask lots of detail-focused questions.</p><p id="Par33" class="Para">Understanding this meta-program, and having the flexibility to adjust our style to think in both big picture and detail, is how we develop our four capacities of Tactical, Strategic, Delivery, and Culture of the Digital Situational Leadership model. We dive deeper into meta-programs in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span> and learn how to tune and adjust them.</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">Once information is filtered by our meta-programs, our brains call into the backend, with the modified information payload.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Human <span id="ITerm18">Backend</span></h3><p id="Par35" class="Para">In our human backend, we utilize our personality structures, stored experiences, and beliefs to create an internal representation of our external reality. This internal representation is much like a movie that plays in our minds that has a particular size, color, music, and sound and sometimes smells and temperature. Intense and emotional movies tend to be bright, colorful, loud, and seemingly played on a very large screen at the front of our minds. Other movies are played more quietly on a small screen and maybe in black and white. All of these movies we create are manufactured in the mind and are created specifically by our backend to represent what we perceive as reality.</p><p id="Par36" class="Para">Like a legacy backend, there is a lot of old logic here, a good deal of which is formed and created in early childhood. Here is where our core personality type sits. We create a perception of reality (from our early experiences), process it, and respond accordingly based on our motivations and fears. Our personality may respond differently to the same request depending on the current load (our stress levels) or erroneous state (our internal representation of reality). We may even respond with the human equivalent of a 500 Server error—a blank expression and no communication!</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">We will look at the personality types and structures in detail in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">Deobfuscation<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> of humans involves the following steps:

Like most good releases, the new release has improved functionality, better processing ability, and potentially some fundamentally new features. Luckily, for humans this new software deployment is not a waterfall, big bang delivery (imagine just how messy that would be). Upgrades to the human stack are rolled out in a small, iterative, Continuous Delivery process. In the next chapter, we take a deeper look at some of these upgrades.</p></div></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par46" class="Para">The “full stack” metaphor in the technical world lends itself well to simplifying the complexities of human behavior.
