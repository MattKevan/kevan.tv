                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">There are three methods to gaining wisdom. The first is reflection, which is the highest. The second is limitation, which is the easiest. The third is experience, which is the bitterest.</em>

So, what is reflection and how do we do it? The Cambridge Dictionary describes the verb Reflect as:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par5" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Reflect: To think carefully, especially about possibilities and opinions.</em>
              </p><p id="Par6" class="Para">—Cambridge Dictionary</p></blockquote><p id="Par7" class="Para">Reflecting is commonly misunderstood to mean only looking backward into the past and “thinking carefully” about what happened, how we and others behaved, and the outcome of the situation. While this is true, reflecting is also the act of deep and focused thought about the future and possibilities.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">As we reflect into the past, we take time to think carefully about our performance, the intentions we set, the actions we took, the actions of others, the outcomes achieved, and how well those outcomes aligned with what we desired. The objective of reflecting backward is to learn from our experiences in order to evolve and increase our performance the next time we face a similar situation.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">We reflect into the future to envision where we want to go and what we want to achieve, and to plan and predict the best course of action to get there. In doing so, we assess the trends that might influence the future and identify where we can be a disruptive catalyst, creating new waves of change.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">In essence, we utilize reflection as a tool to evolve to higher levels of awareness and performance and to create and predict future disruptions (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">17-1</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:11.32em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 17-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">Two <span id="ITerm2">axes of</span> reflection</span></h6></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">

            </h2><p id="Par11" class="Para">An essential outcome of reflection is the <span id="ITerm4">gaining of</span> new <span id="ITerm5">perspectives</span>. In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>, I presented the concept of stages of development (Expert, Achiever, Catalyst), where at each stage, a leader gains a new and wider perspective. We also performed an exercise to demonstrate the increase in perspective by framing your view with your hands (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">17-2</a></span>) and adjusting them to take in more (or less) elements of your field of view.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:18.38em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 17-2. </span><span class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm6">Framing</span> your view with your hands</span></h6></div><p id="Par12" class="Para">For digital leaders, there are a number of perspectives that we need to consider and reflect upon as we assess our past performance and look at future possibilities. As we develop our perspective on reality, we factor in more and more of the ecosystem in which we exist. We gain a broader context that spans an increasing time span, both back into the past and into the future. A micro-perspective involves a finite focus on, say, a task, and is only held for a few hours or minutes. A macro-perspective incorporates numerous systems that span (in some cases) centuries into the past and future. This broad perspective addresses the impact of what we have done and where we want to go with respect to society and the human race itself.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm7">Levels of</span> Perspective</h2><p id="Par13" class="Para">I define 10 levels of perspective (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">17-3</a></span>) that you can use as a framework to reflect upon and develop your awareness. Let’s take a brief look at each level.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.95em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 17-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">Levels of <span id="ITerm8">perspective</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm9">Individual and Team</span>
              </h3><p id="Par14" class="Para">These perspectives are easy to grasp and understand, as they are the perspectives that we have all been accustomed to using. Here, our focus is on the day-to-day interactions and delivery of tasks within our team and the individuals within our team. Our perspective is limited to the work at hand and the people we interact with every day. Holding only this perspective can cause challenges as the individuals and the team “can’t see the wood for the trees.”</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm10">Teams</span>
              </h3><p id="Par15" class="Para">As we take a step back and upward, we incorporate the perspective of the other teams that we interact with. We consider the impact that one team has on the other and we understand that, to have a big impact, we need to combine perspectives and share understanding across teams.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Department, Region, Organization</h3><p id="Par16" class="Para"><span id="ITerm11">Department, region and organization</span> are even broader perspectives that are intra-organizational. As we increase our understanding of how the various departments and regions function together as an entity, we broaden our awareness of the impact and contribution that each has on our outcomes. Our perspective includes the skills and styles that functional silos bring, which acknowledge the very different types of people in, say, a sales department compared to accounting. These perspectives allow us to build more effective relationships across the organization and to predict potential future activities. Here we hold perspectives of people and functions that we may not come into contact with for considerable periods of time, yet we consider how our decisions and actions may impact them and the organization’s objectives.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm12">Industry</span>
              </h3><p id="Par17" class="Para">Considering the industry perspective allows us to view our organization’s market verticals and identify competitors and opportunities that exist outside of our organization. The industry perspective is the first level that allows us, as leaders, to predict and respond to disruption.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">Our longer-term view looking back into the past helps us to understand the key shifts that have happened within our industry, allowing us to facilitate effective decision making in order to solve present day and potential future challenges. We may even go as far as to understand other verticals that may impact our industry as the world evolves.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm13">Technology</span>
              </h3><p id="Par19" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">The digital world has arrived. Technology is driving <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">every</em> industry. Therefore if we want to be successful in our industry and capture new markets, we must hold a perspective on the technical landscape and how the new digital world is transforming, killing, and creating new verticals.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">Leaders who do not take time to reflect on the technology perspective will be disrupted by the ubiquitous nature of technologies (discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>), such as AI, connected devices, the next new thing, etc.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm14">Society and Economy</span>
              </h3><p id="Par21" class="Para">Taking an even broader perspective allows us to view technology and industries in the context of local and global economies and reflect on the events and trends in society over decades. The accelerating pace of change is having a dramatic impact on society and economies. As borders are lowered, diversity appreciated, and the way we live and work changes, it has an existential impact on industry verticals. Economic factors are now a global concern, with no country being immune to significant “market corrections” such as those in the United States that triggered the global financial crisis of 2008.</p><p id="Par22" class="Para">Society’s values, beliefs, laws, and lifestyles are evolving faster than ever and the realization of the end of the office block (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>) will have a dramatic impact on a multitude of industries, including real estate, transport services, infrastructure, energy, insurance, maintenance, hospitality, tourism, and more. The list is almost endless.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Mankind and the <span id="ITerm15">Planet</span></h3><p id="Par23" class="Para">Our final step brings into perspective the history and plight of the environment and of mankind itself. Elon Musk’s purpose (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_12_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">12</span></a></span>)—to make the human race a multi-planetary species—is clearly a broad perspective held on mankind. One might argue that reflection at this level is more akin to philosophy than reality. However, it is true leadership to envision change at this level and execute a strategy that incorporates all of the lower levels of perspectives.</p></div></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Reflection <span id="ITerm16">Framework</span></h2><p id="Par24" class="Para">When we combine the levels of perspective with the two axes of reflection, we have a complete framework that we are able to utilize for our evolution (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">17-4</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:17em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 17-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Reflection framework</span></h6></div><p id="Par25" class="Para">As we reflect on the past, we utilize the various perspective levels to assess our performance. We analyze our intentions, our actions, and the results obtained to generate new insights and lessons that raise our awareness.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">When we look forward into the future, we revisit our vision with our new awareness to ensure that the direction we are heading is still correct and that our values and beliefs are appropriate for success. Equally, we reflect on key trends at each perspective level, such as our organization’s capability and culture, and shifts in industry, technology, and society.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Embracing Change</h2><p id="Par27" class="Para">Evolution is change. Disruption is <span id="ITerm17">change. Change</span> is easy to talk about and less easy to achieve, especially when it comes to our own personal change. It’s common in leadership circles to talk about change (and indeed the pace of change). But, all too often, when people and, in particular, leaders, talk about change, they are referring to the need for others to change (as depicted in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">17-5</a></span>). Anyone that has been through an Agile transformation will be fully aware that to create a truly Agile organization, the leadership team must drive change AND act as role models of change.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_17_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="height:17.08em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 17-5. </span><span class="SimplePara">Who wants (to) change?</span></h6></div><p id="Par28" class="Para">Having a growth mindset (introduced in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_6_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">6</span></a></span>) is critical to the whole evolutionary process. Evolution is the growth and transformation of us as individuals. Change often gets harder the deeper we go down the Human Full Stack. Our Enneagram type motivators are prevalent in all areas of our life and have been with us since we were young. Changing core aspects of our personality takes considerable time if we are to sustain lasting change.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">What prevents us from even attempting change most is fear—namely fear of failing. This fear is not actually a fear of failure itself, but a fear of how we will be judged by others. What we fear is looking stupid, clumsy, or incompetent. Fear is a natural part of being human and it has kept the human race alive since the early caveman days. Fear is designed to keep us safe and protect us from danger. It has a place. It has a purpose. However, in a professional growth context, it can paralyze us which, as leaders, can jeopardize not only us, but also our teams and our organizations.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">What we believe (the frames that we hold) about a situation defines our thoughts. We know from the TEA model (presented in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_14_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">14</span></a></span>) that these thoughts impact our emotions and actions in a circular fashion. Fear is an emotion created by what we think and believe about a scenario. If, for example, we are preparing to deliver a presentation to a large audience and we believe that we aren’t a good presenter (fixed mindset) and because of our fixed mindset, we cannot change, then it is likely that we will create a negative state and perform poorly. If, however, we have a growth mindset, we recognize that we haven’t had a lot of experience presenting and that each presentation is an opportunity to grow and develop our skills. We also understand that even if we are judged poorly by the audience that their judgment is a reflection of their own limitations not ours. With a growth mindset, we create space for positive emotions such as anticipation and excitement. The reality hasn’t changed—it’s the same presentation, same audience, and same presenter—however, what has changed is what we choose to believe about our ability to present and our ability to change!</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm18">Evolutionary Belief System</span>
            </h2><p id="Par31" class="Para">In order to ensure their evolution, Unnatural Leaders have what I call an <span id="ITerm19">
                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">evolutionary belief system</em></span> that empowers their growth and helps them overcome their natural fears. They reflect on these beliefs as they look back into their past and assess their performance, and as they look forward into their future to plan where they will go and what they will do. The five empowering beliefs of the evolutionary belief system are:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par32" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">I am constantly growing, changing, and evolving.</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par33" class="Para">The process of evolving is an enjoyable and natural state for human beings. This belief is at the core of the growth mindset. Knowing we are constantly changing means we can change for the better. It means we aren’t doomed by our genetics or past failures. We know that we aren’t the same person we were last year or even last week. Nor will we be the same next month or next year.</p></li><li><p id="Par34" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">I have full control over my four powers and physical-emotional state.</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par35" class="Para">We always have choice (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_11_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">11</span></a></span>); the choice of whether or not to reflect; the choice of whether to take feedback as criticism or lessons; the choice to see and engage in empowering, positive emotional states or negative ones.</p></li><li><p id="Par36" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Curiosity and experimentation are fundamental to my personal evolution.</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par37" class="Para">Getting curious about new things and giving them a try is essential to accelerate our growth. We are always changing; however, if we don’t experiment and try new things (by getting curious about why, how, and what), then our growth rate will be substantially slower.</p></li><li><p id="Par38" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Feeling strong emotions (such as fear, anger or frustration) is part of our development. Emotions show us our opportunities for growth.</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par39" class="Para">This belief helps our brain rewire itself to embrace the strong feelings that we label as fear (or anger, sadness, frustration, etc.) and not be controlled by them. Believing that these emotions arise when we are growing and that they are a natural part of our evolution helps us to break the negative cycle of feelings, thoughts, and actions.</p></li><li><p id="Par40" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">The only person I can change is myself.</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par41" class="Para">It’s easy to blame other people for the challenges we face. Sometimes, it’s even easier to try to change others than to face our own shortcomings. And when things don’t go as planned, some of us have a tendency to fall into a “victim” mindset, where we believe we are powerless to deal with our negative states until an external person or environment changes for us. However, with this belief, we acknowledge that the only person we can actually change is ourselves, and we take ownership of our own growth through active awareness, intention, attention, and reflection.</p></li></ul><p id="Par42" class="Para">At the earlier stages of development (or for those with a more fixed mindset), the evolutionary belief system can seem like idealized principles that may not be very realistic. Let’s face it, failure isn’t pleasant; it can be embarrassing, expensive, hurtful, and, in some instances, can have a severe impact on careers and lives. Fortunately, a majority of the failure scenarios we experience are more short-term and not catastrophic in nature. These short-term failures pass and, with honest and open reflection, offer us the opportunity for growth.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">While taking time to reflect on the past and into the future, it is beneficial to revisit the evolutionary belief system in order to remind ourselves that we do have control of our state and four powers, and that we are always evolving and growing.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods"><h2 class="Heading">Reflection <span id="ITerm20">Methods</span></h2><p id="Par44" class="Para">There are a variety of methods that we can use for daily and weekly reflection. I suggest that you experiment with each of these methods and establish a process and combination that work for you. Leadership (and life) is complex and chaotic. There are times when we struggle to keep our head above water and times when everything goes smoothly to plan. I suggest that you choose and adjust your reflection methods accordingly to suit your current physical-emotional state and context.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">The following sections discuss the six key methods you can use to facilitate your reflection.</p><div id="Sec14" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 1: <span id="ITerm21">Journaling</span></h3><p id="Par46" class="Para">Journaling is the process of recording notes about our experiences in order to develop insights that we may have otherwise missed during our busy week. The process of journaling creates space for deep reflection as we record our experience (thoughts, emotions, actions) and how effecitvely we performed. Journaling often provides a more objective (less emotional) view of reality as we reflect back, after the experience. Where possible, we journal at the end of each day, and then review our journal notes at the end of each week. This helps us gain a wider perspective of the week and identify any patterns that are valuable for our evolution and performance.</p></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 2: <span id="ITerm22">Feedback</span></h3><p id="Par47" class="Para">Feedback is critical to our evolution and performance as a leader, as it provides us with the subjective perspectives of those we work with. This subjectivity is vitally important to understand because, more often than not, our effectiveness is based on other peoples’ perceptions of us over time (rather than how we believe we performed).</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">Feedback can be solicited in a variety of ways, from informal, impromptu conversations, to organization-wide, structured feedback initiatives.</p></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 3: <span id="ITerm23">Coaching</span></h3><p id="Par49" class="Para">I have espoused the benefit of coaching and the impact it has on accelerating growth throughout this book. Coaching sessions help us reflect to understand why we did what we did, and then focus on the future to create empowering states that are aligned with our true intentions.</p></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 4: <span id="ITerm24">Mentoring</span></h3><p id="Par50" class="Para">Like coaching, mentoring allows us to reflect on the past and plan for the future. However, unlike coaching, mentoring is usually offered by mentors who have experience, knowledge, and perspectives about our domain that we don’t. Mentors can help us to see our blind spots, to think about our domain and leadership differently, and accelerate our learning through the sharing of their insights.</p></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 5: Meditating</h3><p id="Par51" class="Para"><span id="ITerm25">Meditation</span> is extremely valuable for “knowledge workers” such as ourselves, who are constantly connected and juggling technical and leadership priorities. Our roles require us to use our gray matter intensely, all day, every day. Meditation calms the mind (and body), reduces stress, and increases clarity, creativity, and overall performance. The space created for our minds by meditation often presents innovative solutions to challenges that have been ruminating in our heads for a while.</p></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 6: Levels of <span id="ITerm26">Perspective</span></h3><p id="Par52" class="Para">In order to identify trends and create and respond to disruption, we must be aware of the trends and patterns that are driving change. We must continuously gather information at conferences and meet-ups, from online content, from fellow peers, and from thought leaders. This solid foundation of information allows us to utilize the levels of perspective from Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">17-3</a></span> as a framework to reflect on the future, paying particular attention to the technology perspective.</p></div></div><div id="Sec20" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Reducing the <span id="ITerm27">Learning Delay</span></h2><p id="Par53" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">We use reflection to look back on our performance and (hopefully) gain new insights that allow us to improve our effectiveness. If we consider a scenario where we trigger a negative state while interacting with a specific colleague, the gap between our interactions and the realization of our negative pattern may occur days, weeks, or months later. This gap between the real-world event and our realization is what I call the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">learning delay</em>. In some scenarios, we are able to identify the pattern (through journalling) the very same day. In other scenarios, the learning delay may be weeks as we take time to become aware of the patterns we have deeply habituated.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">The more we focus on and watch for a pattern in ourselves, the faster we tend to see it each subsequent time it occurs. Our initial insight may have been weeks after an event. The next few instances we observe the pattern just a few days later, then a few hours, and ultimately in the moment. This in-the-moment awareness allows us to adapt and modify our approach, pulling away from older habits and utilizing new methods of communicating, behaving, thinking, and feeling.</p><p id="Par55" class="Para">Repeated application of the new approach integrates it deeply into our mode of operation until it becomes our normal way of operating. This is our evolution.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">We must, therefore, dedicate time and practice to the assessment of our performance and understanding our thoughts and emotions in order to evolve them to more effective, less stressful, and more satisfying experience of life itself.</p></div><div id="Sec21" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Reflection Is a Lot like <span id="ITerm28">Software Testing</span></h2><p id="Par57" class="Para">Reflection is a lot like testing in software development. Everyone knows it needs to be done well to efficiently build great products, but not all of us do it well. Skipping testing is often a shortcut we take when we’re rushing to meet delivery deadlines. The only way to sustainably increase delivery speed is to increase quality through testing and test automation. It’s a false economy in software development to ignore quality and it’s a false economy in your evolution to ignore the practice of reflection.</p></div><div id="Sec22" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par58" class="Para">Reflection is key to accelerating our evolution. It is the process that we consciously use to assess our past performance and prepare for and create the future. When we embrace change and practice reflection on a regular basis, we accelerate our development.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">Gaining new levels of perspective allows us to better assess our performance and look toward the future to create and respond to change.
