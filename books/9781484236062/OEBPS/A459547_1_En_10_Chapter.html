External information is received through our preferred communication channel(s) and filtered, distorted, or deleted and then processed by our meta-programs in the API layer. The meta-programs then call our backend personality structures, which create and hold our external representation of reality. Our unique personalities are forged through our genes (nature), our upbringing (nurture), our culture, and our experiences. This dynamic combination creates a truly unique, individual personality in each and everyone one of us. This makes our job as digital leaders extremely complex as we endeavor to interact successfully with our customers, stakeholders and teams.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:9.48em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm1">Human backend</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par6" class="Para">However, to be successful, we don’t need to understand the 7 billion or more unique personalities of the people on our planet. In fact, most of us don’t have the time to dive into understanding the key people in our lives (our partner or parents). Yet, what really amplifies our chances of success is getting a basic understanding of the deep motivations that drive a person’s behaviors, thoughts, and emotions.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">Let’s see how this plays out. If a member of your team is deeply motivated by intellectual ability and demonstrating capability and competence, he will often present a very logical personality that thrives on cognitive rigor and knowledge, and, in some cases, can appear quite “emotionless” (Mr. Spock anyone?). This type of person can often be one of the smartest people in the room, having spent their life developing their gray matter. They can also irritate others with their need to intellectualize and analyze every situation, down to the make-up and origins of that rather bland coffee cup in your hand.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">Contrast this with someone who is deeply moved to help others and connect emotionally with them. In a team environment, these people often provide a valuable support network to others. Their challenge is to avoid burning themselves out helping others, leaving little or no capacity for their own personal productivity and self-care.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">As we encounter a person (be that a stakeholder, executive, peer, or member of our team) who demonstrates particular personality traits consistently, we may begin to think about the different styles we can employ in our interactions with them to achieve our desired outcomes. The key is to use a personality framework that honors the richness of the human being, while allowing us to hack through the personality stack, demystifying the people who we are looking to grow, influence and engage with in a more sophisticated manner.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Enneagram</h2><p id="Par10" class="Para">I’ve worked with hundreds of people using the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Enneagram</em> over the last five years. I’ve also run numerous <span id="ITerm2">Enneagram</span> training programs, presentations, workshops, and one-on-one coaching sessions that introduce the Enneagram and how to use it for professional and personal success. Each person who has been through one or more of these engagements has reported back that learning the Enneagram was a significant experience for them and impacted the way they think of themselves and interact with others.</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">The Enneagram has a long history, the basic symbol dating back a few thousand years. The Enneagram Personality system evolved in the 1970s through the work of the Chilean developmental psychologist, Claudio Naranjo. Naranjo developed the main body of work for Enneagram Personality Types, elements of which have been adapted in more recent years by Don Rhiso, Russ Hudson, and others.</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">The Enneagram is effective for <span id="ITerm3">digital leaders</span> for two key reasons:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par13" class="Para">The depth and accuracy of the system is unsurpassed, showing preferences, motivations, thought patterns, mind, body, gut integration, and the shifts that happen for each type under stress and relaxation.</p></li><li><p id="Par14" class="Para">There is a vast, easily accessible body of knowledge available online for when you are ready to drive your own personal development to the next level. The resources available range from books, to YouTube videos, to informative articles, and even online courses.</p></li></ul><p id="Par15" class="Para">The richness and complexity of the Enneagram presents a particular challenge for me in writing this book. With such a broad and deep body of knowledge, communicating just enough of the most valuable aspects of the Enneagram is a balancing act. What I cover in the rest of this chapter is a summary of the nine personality types, their response patterns, and their leadership styles. These three topics give us a veritable treasure chest of knowledge to use in our interactions and personal evolution. Once I’ve piqued your interest, you can continue learning about the enneagram through other channels.</p><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The Enneagram <span id="ITerm4">Symbol</span></h3><p id="Par16" class="Para">The word Enneagram is Greek for nine (ennea) and gram (written or drawn). Essentially it is a personality system that has nine personality types arranged around the outside of a circle, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">10-2</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:23.9em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Enneagram</span></h6></div><p id="Par17" class="Para">The nine types are arranged in a clockwise order around the outside and each one has an arrow pointing away from it and another pointing toward it. These arrows indicate the transitions that happen when each type is either under stress or in health. For Enneagram Type 1, for instance, we can see that the arrow pointing toward it comes from Type 7. This means that when Type 1s are relaxed, they take on the healthier aspects of the Type 7. Conversely, the arrow pointing away from Type 1 points toward Type 4, which means they take on the unhealthy aspects of a Type 4 when stressed.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">Let’s take a closer look at each of the nine types.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Type 1: The Reformer</h3><p id="Par19" class="Para"><span id="ITerm5">Reformers</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">10-3</a></span>) are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong. They seek perfection and feel a dutiful obligation to change and improve things for the better. They are often highly organized and provide detail, quality, and diligence to teams.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">Reformers can be critical of those around them. Their perfection seeking can come at the cost of delivering value early or personal burn out, working extremely long hours to get the job done to their own high standards.</p><p id="Par21" class="Para">At their best, they are wise, discerning, and noble.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.63em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm6">Reformer</span></span></h6></div></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Type 2: The Helper</h3><p id="Par22" class="Para"><span id="ITerm7">Helpers</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">10-4</a></span>) are the most relationship-focused type. They’re empathetic, supportive, and sincere. Their people and relationship focus helps build healthy cultures, but can become overly focused on the happiness and support of others, losing sight of the need for productivity and outcomes. They often take on people support, coaching or mentoring roles in organizations, providing much needed individual growth for those in the organization they assist. Their focus on others can see them burn themselves out, at which point they can become stressed and demanding. At their best they are altruistic and have unconditional love for others.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.63em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm8">Helper</span></span></h6></div></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Type 3: The Achiever</h3><p id="Par23" class="Para"><span id="ITerm9">Achievers</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">10-5</a></span>) are self-assured and charismatic.

They are often creative types drawn to technology through the art of creating products (either as designers or developers). They love to deep-dive into the meaning of things and value work tied to a bigger meaning and purpose. Motivation can be a challenge for individualists, as they often avoid what they see as mundane, ordinary activities that may be detailed in nature. They are often ideators and innovators, connecting seemingly disparate topics in new inventive ways. Under stress, individualists can be moody and difficult to manage, wanting special attention from the people around them.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.63em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm12">Individualist</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par26" class="Para">At their best, individualists are inspired and highly creative and are able to renew themselves and transform their experiences.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Type 5: The Investigator</h3><p id="Par27" class="Para"><span id="ITerm13">Investigators</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">10-7</a></span>) are alert, insightful, and curious.

They are decisive in action, but can also be demanding and controlling. Challengers want to control their environment and shy away from any personal vulnerability. This often sees them quickly reaching leadership roles and then struggling to lead at scale, where vulnerability and engagement of others plays a significant part of success.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig10"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig10_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig10_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.42em" id="MO10" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-10. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm20">Challenger</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par34" class="Para">Challengers are extremely protective of the people in their “tribe” and can become vengeful if they perceive either themselves or their tribe as being under attack.

These are our human backend systems that process requests received from our API layer and meta-programs and provide a response. We can think of the nine types as nine different backend codebases. Each of the nine codebases has a set of motivators and particular ways of responding and leading. Each person whom we interact with has forked one of these original nine codebases by the age of seven and developed their own personalized branch of the original Enneagram <span id="ITerm23">type codebase</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig12">10-12</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig12"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig12_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_10_Fig12_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.92em" id="MO12" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 10-12. </span><span class="SimplePara">Forking of the Enneagram <span id="ITerm24">type codebase</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par40" class="Para">This concept is important because even though two people may be the same Enneagram type (the same original codebase), they don’t usually respond exactly the same. They do respond according to the same base behaviors of the original codebase (Enneagram type), but with individualization that is coded from their unique human experience. These experiences instill different beliefs, values, and memories that configure each person’s meta-programs differently.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">However, two people of the same Enneagram type (or original codebase) will behave and respond relatively similarly compared to that of the responses from two different Enneagram types. For example, consider a scenario where Bob asks two of his direct reports—Mark (Peacemaker – Type 9) and Dave (Challenger – Type 8)—the same question: “What do you think we need to change in our team dynamic in order to improve performance?”</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">Mark’s response is “Well, I’d like to confirm with the team first, but I think we could allow members of the team to vote on the work we do, or maybe run more retrospectives to allow the team to tune performance.”</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">Bob challenges this with “Hmmm, we have already tried that and it didn’t work, because the team never came to an agreement and spent too much time in discussions.”</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">Mark responds with “True, yes that’s right. It’s a tough one, I’m not sure. There are lots of little things we could try…”</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">Mark’s peacemaker response pattern is to agree and see similarities in what Bob is saying. He struggles with seeing the world in black and white, right and wrong, and making a clear stand because of his fear of creating conflict and disruption. He instantly tries to deflect the question and redirects back to the team, so as not to become the source of any aggravation.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">In contrast, Dave responds: “Steve (another team member) is the problem. You need to fire him. Steve just isn’t competent enough and doesn’t act like he’s part of the team. In fact, I question his loyalty to the team full stop. I’ve had multiple arguments with him and he just doesn’t see reality. “</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">Bob challenges this with “Thanks Dave, but could it be that it’s just a clash of your personalities that’s causing you this frustration?”</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">Dave responds with “Are you saying it’s all my fault now? It’s not. I’m the one that gets stuff done around here. If you don’t fire Steve then I am going to quit.”</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">Dave’s response is in stark contrast to Mark’s (as is often the case with peacemakers and challengers). Right out of the gate we can sense that Dave wants control and is holding some vengeance against Steve. His suggestion is forcefully made and very black and white—fire Steve! When challenged by Bob he becomes defensive and threatens to quit, looking to gain control of the situation. It’s common for challengers to consider themselves to be right and they tend to struggle with vulnerability. Challengers also protect their own inner circle. Here we can see that Dave dislikes Steve in part because he doesn’t see him as a team player.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">Here we have the same scenario, same leader, same team, and two individuals: Mark who forked the Peacemaker (Type 9) backend codebase and Dave who forked the Challenger (Type 8) <span id="ITerm25">codebase</span>. They both add value and present Bob with a set of challenges to deal with. Bob probably needs to work with Mark on his decision making and self-authority, while with Dave he may choose to work on softening those aspects of his character. Bob may even choose to use Mark and Dave as role models for each other as the focus on the growth of this team and the individuals within it.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Common Technical Types</h2><p id="Par51" class="Para">There isn’t a strong dominant type that is drawn to technical work. That said, investigators (Type 5) are very commonly found in engineering roles. Their cerebral nature draws them to any field where they can enjoy problem solving and analysis. The creative, art-like nature of development (either software or hardware) also sees a number of individualists (Type 4) expressing themselves in design and code. Equally, reformers (Type 1) are drawn to testing, quality, and compliance type roles. All types can be found in teams. As a leader, the key is to find balance across all types and put people into roles where they will thrive.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Which Balance of Types Makes a Great Team?</h2><p id="Par52" class="Para">This is the most common <span id="ITerm26">question</span> leaders ask me, once they understand the basics of the Enneagram. Team dynamics are immensely complex and the demands on the team change over time, so there really isn’t a “best team” type composition. Like strengths and weaknesses, a high-performing team will generally have a good balance of all skills required. The same applies for personality types. Each type brings with it a set of strengths and weaknesses. Without any context of the team, the only advice I give is: A sub-optimal team is skewed toward only one type.</p></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Common <span id="ITerm27">Leadership</span> Types</h2><p id="Par53" class="Para">Anecdotally the two types that I see most often in senior/executive leadership roles are achievers and challengers. That’s not to say other types don’t become leaders. They absolutely do. However, western business appreciates and rewards these two types with leadership positions because:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par54" class="Para">Achievers, by their very nature, are focused on achieving success. They live by goals and outcomes and are very well suited to the performance demands of most organizations. Their charismatic, chameleon-like nature also enables them to inspire and lead in multiple different ways, suiting the needs of the people and context.</p></li><li><p id="Par55" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">The achiever leader has to guard against what I call the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">performance paradox trap</em>. Their singular focus on performance can cause them to ignore the more personal scenarios, such as conflict and employee morale, as they see time spent solving these as unproductive. Failing to deal with these often leads to severe team underperformance and eventually into the performance paradox trap of ever-decreasing performance.</p></li><li><p id="Par56" class="Para"><span id="ITerm28">Challengers</span> lead from the front and love getting lots done. Challengers are what some might call natural leaders. They want control and aren’t afraid to make decisions (based on gut instinct).

Bringing this into consciousness can often lead to a realization that some of these (subconcious) motivations are no longer relevant, and in some cases are pulling us away from what we really want.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">Once we have identified our core type, we can then begin to look at the inter-personal differences in style and motivations and design a strategy to align the two for mutual benefit.</p><p id="Par60" class="Para"><span id="ITerm30">Assessing</span> your Enneagram type can be done in a number of ways, including online testing, coaching, and various other typing tools such as cards. The most common mechanism is the online test. I use two providers for this—The Enneagram Institute<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> and Integrative Enneagram Solutions.<a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a> Both providers offer a basic test for around $15 US; however, Integrative also offer in-depth reports for professionals (which I use in my digital leadership coaching programs). Select the one that you feel most aligned with and take the test.</p><p id="Par63" class="Para">Once you have your results, allocate some quiet time to absorb them and, if required, read further into the type descriptions. Do you identify with what the report is saying? There are some instances where the Enneagram assessments struggle to find your type based on your answers (loyalists are often mistyped). The key here is to read more deeply into the nine types until you find the core patterns that resonate with you. Some of these patterns you may not like and you may not want them to define you. That’s perfectly normal. It’s common for people to dislike their own type the most (with the exception of enthusiasts and challengers).</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">Once you have identified and understood your type, reflect on what that type means for you and your life and how it might impact what you are aiming to achieve. How do you operate differently from your boss, your stakeholders, and the members of your team? How does your type impact your relationships with your spouse, friends, and family? What types might they be? What might you change in order to bring more of what you want into your life?</p></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Identifying Others’ Types</h2><p id="Par66" class="Para">There are two categories of people that we need to understand deeper—people who work under our leadership (e.g., our teams and direct reports) and those who don’t (e.g., stakeholders and our leaders).</p><p id="Par67" class="Para">For those who work under our leadership (in particular those who report directly to us), I strongly recommend running Enneagram sessions together as a team. During these team sessions, explore the Enneagram system and the nine types. You’ll discover each team member’s Enneagram type and how each type behaves in a team and responds to conflict. These sessions increase team and individual awareness, which reduces frustrations and increases communication and productivity.</p><p id="Par68" class="Para">The vast majority of people who we want improved interactions with won’t have been involved in an Enneagram assessment or workshop, and therefore we won’t have access to their typing scores. So we need some clues to help us understand which of the nine types they might be. The first place to start is to look at the way the nine types respond and lead.</p><p id="Par69" class="Para">The response patterns and leadership styles of the nine types are summarized in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">10-1</a></span>.</p><div id="Tab1" class="Table"><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 10-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm31">Response Patterns and Leadership Styles</span> of the Nine Types</span></h6><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p class="SimplePara">Type</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">Response Patterns</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">Leadership Styles</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">1 – Reformer</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Aim for perfection</p><p class="SimplePara">Black and white thinking</p><p class="SimplePara">Dutiful obligation to make things right</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Lead by example</p><p class="SimplePara">Focus on quality and excellence</p><p class="SimplePara">Can make others feel judged or inferior</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">2 – Helper</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Provide praise and flattery</p><p class="SimplePara">Focus on relationships</p><p class="SimplePara">Caring, empathetic, and dutiful</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Strong connections with people</p><p class="SimplePara">Supportive and motivating</p><p class="SimplePara">Can burn themselves out</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">3 – <span id="ITerm32">Achiever</span></p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Care about how they will be seen</p><p class="SimplePara">Focus on outcomes and success</p><p class="SimplePara">Charismatic and assertive</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Performance Focused</p><p class="SimplePara">Goals and structure for success</p><p class="SimplePara">Avoidance of emotions</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">4 – Individualist</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Desire to express themselves</p><p class="SimplePara">Creativity and ideation</p><p class="SimplePara">Will want to know why they need to do something</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Create meaning and purpose</p><p class="SimplePara">Inspire creativity</p><p class="SimplePara">Avoidance of mundane</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">5 – Investigator</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Take a systems perspective</p><p class="SimplePara">Knowledge is power</p><p class="SimplePara">Intellectualize the situation and understand how</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Create effective organizations</p><p class="SimplePara">Research and deliberation</p><p class="SimplePara">May detach and become aloof</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">6 – Loyalist</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Analysis of options and what might go wrong</p><p class="SimplePara">Detailed planning</p><p class="SimplePara">Focus on their group and seek advice</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Group problem solving</p><p class="SimplePara">Empowering leadership style</p><p class="SimplePara">Can have cycles of indecision</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">7 – <span id="ITerm33">Enthusiast</span></p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Excitement and energy</p><p class="SimplePara">Positive focus on the big picture</p><p class="SimplePara">Can become distracted</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Drive innovation and new ventures</p><p class="SimplePara">Create excitement in people</p><p class="SimplePara">Long-term execution can be a challenge</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">8 – Challenger</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Gain control or protect</p><p class="SimplePara">Moved to action</p><p class="SimplePara">Can become vengeful</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Lead from the front</p><p class="SimplePara">Decisive and empowering</p><p class="SimplePara">Can be demanding of people</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">9 – Peacemaker</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Look for similarities</p><p class="SimplePara">Put others first</p><p class="SimplePara">Disconnect and daydream</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">Build a collective mission</p><p class="SimplePara">Create a harmonious culture</p><p class="SimplePara">Can be passive-aggressive</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p id="Par70" class="Para">Let’s look at a scenario where our fictional character Bob (from Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>) is holding a one-on-one with a new stakeholder named Jenny, who also recently joined the organization.</p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Bob and Jenny are at a local coffee shop and are talking through the various initiatives and challenges they are both working on. Bob’s reason for asking Jenny for coffee was to build a longer-term relationship with her. Jenny’s role in the organization is to lead the call center that supports the products that Bob’s team develops. As such, Bob considered Jenny to be a customer too. (Nice work Bob.)</p><p id="Par72" class="Para">Bob had recently learned the Enneagram system and strongly identified with his Enneagram type score of the <span id="ITerm34">achiever</span>. Through this discovery process, he has realized that he has a tendency to drive people hard toward outcomes and, on occasion, avoid conflicts that seemed to him to be a waste of time.</p><p id="Par73" class="Para">Aside from his desire to build a relationship with Jenny, Bob also wanted to figure out what Enneagram type Jenny might be and apply his newfound knowledge for a better outcome. (Be careful Bob, don’t over-focus on outcomes.)</p><p id="Par74" class="Para">As they chatted over coffee, Bob observed that Jenny knew every member of her team personally and obviously valued the personal interactions she had with them. Jenny had focused her side of the conversation on getting a better understanding of who Bob was a person and how she could help him. He found her to be very pleasant and positive, often complimenting him on his achievements and viewpoints of the organization. When Bob asked Jenny why she had left her previous organization, she complained about the workload, the long hours, and juggling the demands of the people in the organization. Worse still, she received no appreciation or recognition from her leader, who quite insultingly gave her below average performance feedback for not delivering against her own personal objectives.</p><p id="Par75" class="Para">Bob began processing this and believed he had understood Jenny’s Enneagram type—have you? If not, take a moment to assess the story against the Enneagram types.</p><p id="Par76" class="Para">Bob had correctly identified Jenny as a helper. Jenny’s focus was definitely people—she had focused on understanding Bob and already had a good sense of her team at a personal level. Jenny also had a positive and flattering conversational manner. Bob assumed that Jenny’s challenges at her previous role had, in part, come from her desire to help others, which caused her to burn out. He finalized that assumption when he heard that her efforts were not appreciated.</p><p id="Par77" class="Para">Bob now had two valuable pieces of information: he knew that he was an achiever and that Jenny was a helper. This meant he would have to be really conscious of his performance focus, which at times ignored the people involved, and that, in his interactions with Jenny, he needed to focus on appreciation for her assistance and clearly ask for help when he needed it. The Enneagram goes a lot deeper than this somewhat superficial level, but as you can see, this basic knowledge can make the difference between a strong and productive relationship and a poor, conflicting one.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">It’s not always easy to type other people correctly. Most Enneagram types respond to appreciation, and a lot of leaders (irrespective of their type) get to know their teams. What we see on the outside as a behavior isn’t always directly indicative of a person’s Enneagram type. A more productive and safer way to build this relationship would have been for Bob to directly share his newfound Enneagram knowledge and his own type. Sharing at this level would have demonstrated his commitment to personal development and an openness to share and collaborate. It would then give Bob and Jenny the chance to directly discuss what type Jenny might be.</p><p id="Par79" class="Para">If you are making private assumptions as to someone else’s type, always be aware that they are only your assumptions and may not be accurate. As Bob’s relationship with Jenny develops over time, he has the opportunity to validate and check his assumptions as he varies his approach accordingly and gets to know more about Jenny’s personality.</p><p id="Par80" class="Para">One other approach we can use to type a person (which is implicit in this scenario) is to understand the basic motivators of each type.</p><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The Nine WIIFMs (or Nine Motivations)</h3><p id="Par81" class="Para"><span id="ITerm35">WIIFM</span> stands for What’s In It For <span id="ITerm36">Me</span>? A question that each of us asks (sometimes consciously but often subconsciously) during our professional interactions. At the earlier levels of development (achiever and earlier), “What’s In It For Me?” is a primary driver for how we behave.</p><p id="Par82" class="Para">It’s so easy to become engrossed in what <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">we</em> want and what’s in it for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">us</em>, that we forget to focus on what’s important to the other person. If we ignore what the other person is looking to achieve (what they want), they will soon pick up on this and begin to disconnect from the relationship. They may even begin to demand and force their outcomes more explicitly as the relationship dissolves into a power struggle (we’ve all seen those haven’t we?).</p><p id="Par83" class="Para">Utilizing our knowledge of the Enneagram, we have a concise list of nine core WIIFMs, one for each of the types, as shown in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab2">10-2</a></span>.</p><div id="Tab2" class="Table"><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 10-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The WIIFMs for Each <span id="ITerm37">Enneagram Type</span><span id="ITerm38">

This can look similar in nature to the achiever who needs to be seen and validated.
