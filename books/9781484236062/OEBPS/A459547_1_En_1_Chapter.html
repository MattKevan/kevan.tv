              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Vladimir Nabokov<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par5" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Disruption, innovation, turbulence, change, and competition</strong> are words that define our world today. If you aren’t aware of this already, you’re in trouble! If you are, then you have likely been looking at how best to respond to these changes. Maybe you are a leading edge innovator creating your own waves of disruption and watching your competition struggle to stay afloat. Congratulations if you are, but you’re not safe either. The ocean endlessly sends wave after wave, and at some point, your ride is going to be over. You then need to paddle hard, back out through the swell to catch your next wave. All too often, leaders and innovators achieve success and then stagnate. They fail to paddle back out into the swell, to adapt, change, and learn new skills. Their wave ends, washing them up high on the beach and then it’s too late for them to go back out again. Equally, new leaders often crash out of the wave early and can’t pick themselves back up to try again! Digital Leadership is a game of survival of the fittest.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para"><span id="ITerm1">Darwin’s theory</span> of Natural Selection prunes out the weakest individuals, who are least suited to the changing environment. Our human evolution occurs slowly, over millions of years, adapting as needed to the earth’s climate and food supply. In the digital ocean, waves come a lot faster and more often than this, sometimes accompanied by hurricane force winds and rain.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">One such storm is the combination of <span id="ITerm2">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span> and <span id="ITerm3">Virtual Reality (VR)—</span>these are dramatically changing society and the way we work. Artificial intelligence will commoditize a significant number of jobs, including software development. It began with the basic automation of mundane tasks and is progressing to more advanced jobs such as X.ai’s, Amy, the artificially intelligent personal assistant. Eventually, AI and (Ro)bots will perform fully automated product development in a conversational manner with humans. Virtual reality will change the way we work, and more specifically, where we work. We are only a few years away from the end of the office block, as the majority of the knowledge-based workforce will connect remotely into virtual offices. These two tsunami waves are creating immense change, right now!</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">As digital leaders, we need to evolve faster than this pace of change; we need to hone our skills and capabilities to constantly ride on top of the waves. Unnatural Selection is a framework for how to become a leader who does this. It isn’t a framework that shifts you once; it’s a framework that drives your constant evolution, keeping you sharp and ready for each new wave of change. It gets you paddling back out there faster and easier, and even helps you select your wave. Grab your board and let’s go find the waves!</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Our Journey</h2><p id="Par9" class="Para">On an evolutionary scale, an individual human life is short. The average life expectancy is mere pinprick of 70 years in a universe that is thought to have been in existence for 14 billion! During our lifetime, our hearts will beat an average of 2.5 billion times, and so I want to start by deeply thanking you for choosing to share some of those heartbeats with me as we go on this journey.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">However, this is more than a journey, this is the start of a relationship. A relationship that I hope will continue past the life of this book, where we form a community of like-minded people creating the best future for our fellow humans, future generations, and our planet.</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">I want our relationship to be a two-way conversation, not a one-way download of what I have to say to you. We have the technology to connect, share, and talk almost anywhere in the world and even meet physically when the opportunity presents itself. I am in constant evolution, just as you are, and you have as much to offer me as I do you.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par12" class="Para">For more information about the community, visit <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://evolvingdigitalleadership.com"><span class="RefSource">

It’s how we have learned to test a concept to see if it makes sense. We find the edges of it—the faults and issues—and we challenge them. It’s a learning strategy and it serves us really well. The problem is, we “yes, but” so much that we don’t even know we are doing it. This is a real issue in conversations when a team member or stakeholder shares an idea or suggestion and the first thing we respond with is “yes, but,…”. It subconsciously tells the other party that you have negated what they said. (Unless of course the other party is an experienced coach, in which case they understand immediately your mental filters.)</p><p id="Par14" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">So in service of any “yes, buts…” you may have about this book: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Evolving Digital Leadership is my offer to you.</em> My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find at least one key concept that resonates, and it will change the way you think and operate in the world for the better. You may have a strong aversion to some aspects of what I am offering, and that’s okay too. Take what you want; reject what you don’t. You will get exactly what you are meant to get from this book, exactly when you are meant to get it.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">This Book Isn’t an Agile Book</h2><p id="Par15" class="Para">I love Agile. I have over 14 years of experience in <span id="ITerm4">Agile product development</span> and large-scale, enterprise transformations in the UK, United States, Australia, and China. I’ve presented at numerous Agile conferences globally and have achieved various Agile certifications, including becoming one of the first Certified Scrum Coaches (in 2008). I cut my teeth early on Agile and it’s provided an amazing foundation in product, people, and process understanding. If you don’t have at least a basic grasp of Agile, I urge you to develop one first and then return to this book once you have those skills dialed in. This book is an evolutionary step beyond the mechanics of Agile and implicitly includes its values and principles.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">It Isn’t a Generic Leadership Book Either</h2><p id="Par16" class="Para">There are a plethora of great leadership books available and, therefore, I don’t believe the world needs yet another leadership book. What it does need is a book by a digital leader, for digital leaders. A book that approaches the subject of leading technical teams and organizations, founded on years of technical experience within those teams.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">With the right complement of skills, technologists are the best people to lead other technologists. We think and operate differently than others; we are wired for cognition and problem solving and for building things, sometimes even invisible things. Our work is complicated, complex, and chaotic. Our products and services are pervasive. What we create and build will be utilized in almost every aspect of society. Digital is the future; we are the future. We need to be ready to lead better, to create better products, better teams, better organizations, and a better society. Are you up for the challenge? If so, read on…</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">How to Use This Book</h2><p id="Par18" class="Para">I’ve designed this book so that the content is valuable, digestible, and actionable. The high-level structure is such that you can choose how you digest the material.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">The main body of the book contains digital leadership content and the Unnatural Selection framework. At the front and back of the book are two productivity hacks—the “Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR)” chapter (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_2_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">2</span></a></span>) and the “It’s Not Cheating” chapter (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_21_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">21</span></a></span>), respectively.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">The “TL;DR” chapter summarizes the whole book in one chapter. That way, in about an hour, you can get an overview of the concepts, principles, and frameworks presented. The “It’s Not Cheating” chapter contains links to full color, downloadable versions of the visuals used throughout the book you may freely use as appropriate. You can, if you like, read the “TL;DR” chapter and then cherry pick the content you want from the main body and the visuals. If you have the time, you will get most value from reading the book sequentially. If you don’t have the time, ask yourself: What’s more important than developing your digital leadership capability?</p><p id="Par21" class="Para">The main body of the book consists of five parts, as discussed next.</p><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Part I: <span id="ITerm5">Digital Leadership</span></h3><p id="Par22" class="Para">This section sets the groundwork for the journey by outlining the path to digital leadership, recommendations for a successful career, the evolution of digital leadership over time, and the introduction to the Unnatural Selection framework. Once you have a basic understanding of the framework, Parts II-V break down each step of the framework, guide you through the concepts, and explain how to execute it.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Part II: <span id="ITerm6">Awareness</span></h3><p id="Par23" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">The first step in the Unnatural Selection framework is awareness. This part of the book provides three highly valuable awareness downloads, which bootstrap your <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">understanding of people</strong>. You can read this part in isolation if you are solely interested in understanding how people work, their stages of development, and their personalities and preferences. These are presented through the analogy of the human as a full technology stack.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Part III: <span id="ITerm7">Intention</span></h3><p id="Par24" class="Para">The power of intentionality—choosing and becoming focused on what you want—is critical to success. In this section, we look at how to set and hold intentions, and we explore three intents for digital leadership success, focusing on self, team, and stakeholders.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Part IV: <span id="ITerm8">Attention</span></h3><p id="Par25" class="Para">With our intentions set, Part IV looks at our attention and how to execute Unnatural Leadership on a daily basis. We explore tools and techniques that enable our personal evolution, empower the growth of our teams, and build long-lasting stakeholder relationships.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Part V: <span id="ITerm9">Reflection</span></h3><p id="Par26" class="Para">Evolution is raising our awareness through reflection and learning. This part of the book looks at ways to evolve effectively through journaling, reflecting, and feedback loops. We also look at concepts such as judgment and the fear of failure that prevent many us from asking for and processing feedback constructively.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm10">Self-Reflection</span> Questions</h3><p id="Par27" class="Para">At the end of each chapter there are questions designed to help you absorb the material from the chapter. I can’t stress enough the importance of investing your time in working through these questions. They will help you translate the book from theory into actionable, real results.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para">So, what’s your intention for reading this book? What do you really want to become? Are you committed to this journey or just mildly interested? Stop and think about that for a minute. When you are ready, grab a drink, get comfy, and let’s dive in!</p></div></div><div class="FootnoteSection"><h1 class="Heading">Footnotes</h1><div class="Footnote" id="Fn1"><p id="Par4" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn1_source">1</a> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</em>, by Vladimir Nabokov (1941)</p></div></div></div></div>
