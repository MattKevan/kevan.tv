The objective of this chapter is to help you create a list of what is important to you in your life. The list you create will be specific to you and your situation, but it will contain elements of what all Unnatural Leaders deem important. However, for the items on the list to be compelling, it is crucial that it is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">your</em> list—not the company’s list, or your boss’ list, or your colleagues’ list. The items must be valuable to you!</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:6.95em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 12-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">Understand, Step 2 of the Clarity Process</span></h6></div><p id="Par5" class="Para">To figure out what is important, we will start by looking at the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators and how our Enneagram type impacts what is important to us. We will then progress further up the Human Full Stack and explore three meta-programs that shape our idea of a <span id="ITerm2">quality life</span>.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">Once we have our list, we will complete Step 2 of the Clarity Process by looking at the three things that are important to all Unnatural Leaders and how they drive us toward digital leadership success.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The <span id="ITerm3">Challenge</span></h2><p id="Par7" class="Para">For some of us, the challenge is that we don’t know what we want. It might be that we find it hard to plan for the future because we don’t know what our options are. For others, we might not like being constrained by making one single choice and prefer to keep our options open. Sometimes we know what we want, but people in our social circle expect something else from us, and we feel obliged to fulfill their expectations.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">Often money is a driver and is either an integral part of our intentions or conflicts with them. Our society considers success as status and wealth. It measures our success by luxury cars, big houses, the latest gadgets, designer clothes, and extravagant vacations. We might value these too, and so we make career choices that chase the dollar but pay the penalty of dissatisfaction with our jobs.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">What we need to understand is that success is an inside job. Success is a combination of our internal thoughts and feelings—it’s not a concrete thing that we obtain from someone or somewhere else. Winning a competition, becoming a CTO, or buying the house we’ve always dreamed of, all do one thing: they trigger positive emotions inside us and we “feel” successful.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">Success means different things to each of us, and it changes over time and through our stages of development. At the earlier stages of development (where many of us are at the start of our careers), we struggle balancing extrinsic (social) and intrinsic (desire) motivators. Let’s explore the difference between the two.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm4">Extrinsic Motivators</span>
              <span id="ITerm5">
                
              </span>
            </h2><p id="Par11" class="Para">Extrinsic motivators drive us to engage in something in order to receive some form of external reward. The rewards can be either tangible or intangible in nature. Common tangible rewards include pay rises, cars, houses, and trophies. Intangible rewards are psychological rewards and include promotions (higher status), praise, and public acclaim.</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">All too often we perform activities that we don’t fully enjoy to receive these external rewards. For most of us, the reality is that we have to work to earn a wage that we use to pay for our accommodation, food, and living costs. Therefore, there is usually a level of extrinsic motivation that is required to live. Where we start to create problems for ourselves is when we chase bigger and bigger external rewards by working harder and longer in jobs that we don’t enjoy.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm6">Intrinsic Motivators</span>
              <span id="ITerm7">
                
              </span>
            </h2><p id="Par13" class="Para">Intrinsic motivators propel us toward something that gives us an internal reward—satisfaction, fulfillment, and gratification. Examples of intrinsically motivated activities are painting, drawing, or reading. It may be that what we do also attracts an external reward—if we sold our painting we would receive money as an external reward. The key difference is whether or not we paint primarily for the enjoyment of painting (intrinsic motivation) or the financial reward (extrinsic motivation).</p><p id="Par14" class="Para">In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Drive,</em><a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a> Pink identifies three core intrinsic motivators:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par16" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Autonomy</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par17" class="Para">We are driven internally by a desire to control our destiny. We want to be able to choose what we do, where we do it, when we do it, with whom we do it, and how we do it. This involves leaders posing challenging questions and giving the team space to generate solutions, rather than micro-managing and prescribing solutions that we think are appropriate. When we have autonomy, we feel empowered and in control of our lives. This will also lead to a feeling of satisfaction in a job well done.</p></li><li><p id="Par18" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Mastery</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Developing our skills and expertise in something we are interested in or care about is a key motivator. 100% interest goes a long way to 110% effort. Mastering our craft (particularly at the Expert stage of development) is critical to our motivation levels. Digital is a cerebral industry and expertise and intellect is a highly regarded commodity in building products and services.</p></li><li><p id="Par20" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Purpose</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par21" class="Para">We want to know that what we do, the products that we build, are of benefit to others. When what we do has a positive impact on other humans, we deem our work as having meaning and purpose. Without meaning and purpose, we quickly become demotivated and our chances of achieving success diminish rapidly.</p></li></ul><p id="Par22" class="Para">Pink defines people that are primarily driven by intrinsic motivators as Type I people, and those that are driven more by extrinsic motivators as Type X. His research shows that in the long term, Type Is always outperform Type Xs as their energy and motivation is a renewable resource. As leaders we need to be consciously aware of this fact.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">Our level of development and personality type determine how strongly we are driven by extrinsic motivators. Earlier developmental levels such as Expert and Achiever are motivated more by extrinsic motivators. Intrinsic motivators are present at all stages. However, as our development progresses, external rewards become less and less meaningful.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">As our developmental level progresses to late-stage Achiever, Catalyst, and beyond, our values and beliefs become more integrated, and we start to become more driven by our intrinsic motivators and values. Meaningful work and impact become more and more important to us. We also start to define our purpose in life. How we define purpose depends on our unique personality and perspectives. For some of us, our purpose is to have a positive impact on the planet; for others, it’s to help the underprivileged; and for others, it’s to create a harmonious home life for their family.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Midlife <span id="ITerm8">Crisis</span><span id="ITerm9">
                
              </span>: The Painful Transition from Achiever to Catalyst</h2><p id="Par25" class="Para">Transitioning from Achiever to Catalyst can often be a painful and lonely process. Western society has collectively progressed to an Achiever-level of development. This means that there are strong external motivators for us to keep up with the Jones’, and so, as we progress beyond this stage, society can hold us back. When we develop into the early stage of Catalyst, our values and worldview shift and we, as a result, no longer appreciate or want the things that society is structured for.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">We are no longer driven primarily toward financial success and materialism and instead want to contribute to meaningful work, have a positive impact on others, and leave behind a positive legacy. This causes us to critically question the actions of organizations and leaders that disrespect race, class, and gender, or damage the environment. In some cases, we completely reject “normal” society and what it stands for, becoming quite angry at the world.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par27" class="Para">In psychology, we call this stage (with its anger aimed at the Achiever society) Mean Green. Where green is the label given by Integral Theory<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> for this stage of development.</p></div><p id="Par29" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">As we reject society’s way of being, it looks to others (at Achiever level and earlier) like we are having a midlife crisis—we are not. To society, it looks like we are going off the rails and “losing our minds” when, in reality, what we are doing is developing our consciousness further toward a more integrated values and belief system that is driven primarily by intrinsic motivators. I prefer to call this process a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">midlife awakening</em>.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">What makes this a lonely process is the lack of connection we feel with our friends, family, and social circles who still value expertise, achievement, and conforming to society’s norms. Our social circles become either frustrating or boring as our worldviews and the people in our circles begin to misalign. This can, in some instances, pull us back into Achiever, where it’s easier to keep doing what we always did and what everyone else expects of us.</p><p id="Par31" class="Para">There are many actions we can take to help ourselves through this transition, but I believe the two most important are thus:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par32" class="Para">To develop our social circles to more reflect our changing worldview.</p></li><li><p id="Par33" class="Para">To enlist the services of a coach who will assist us in our understanding and processing of our shift to Catalyst. Coaches and coaching organizations often have a community of people who are making similar transitions and who are focused on similar personal development journeys.</p></li></ul><p id="Par34" class="Para">The Achiever to Catalyst transition aside, let’s utilize the Human Full Stack as a tool to understand what is important to us by looking at how our meta-programs and personality type influence our motivations.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">

Our Enneagram type (discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>) defines a set of motivations and fears that transcend shorter-term desires such as career promotions.

We then set powerful intentions that align with what we deeply desire.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">Let’s look at the individualist (Type 4) as an example. (This is my Enneagram type.) As this name suggests, the individualist’s core motivator is to express themselves as unique and different. This desire influences their choices to include creativity and variety. Creativity draws individualists toward activities that allow for expression such as product creation, strategic visioning, business building, art, music, etc. Creating something new and different is an enjoyable process for Type 4s and has added significance if what they create is meaningful to them.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">Individualists generally don’t like being controlled or having to conform to normality—how can they be individuals if they are the same as everyone else? Avoiding normality sees them search for variety and avoidance of the mundane, routine aspects of life.</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">Use Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">12-1</a></span> and your Enneagram type to help identify what is important to you and what you must, therefore, consider when thinking about the future and setting your own empowering and meaningful intentions.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">Let’s now take a look at the next layer in the Human Full Stack—the meta-programs layer and the key meta-programs that affect what’s important to us.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Three Meta-Programs That Impact What Is Important</h3><p id="Par42" class="Para">There are three key <span id="ITerm15">meta-programs</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">12-3</a></span>) that impact what is important to us: Quality of Life, Preference, and Attention.

Unsurprisingly, those of us who have this preference are often social beings. When we have a preference for people, we dislike being on our own and can suffer from loneliness more than others. People are important and, as you can imagine, will be central in the intentions we set.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">place</em> means that we focus on where we are, our location and geography. This preference usually gives us a high awareness of our surroundings and environment. In some instances, we search for new and exciting locations, in others we want a familiar or safe place.</p><p id="Par51" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">things</em> brings focus to what is in our environment and we take pleasure from both the tangible things (gadgets, car, house) and intangible things (qualifications, status). In a professional context, this preference tends to mean we enjoy working more with things rather than people.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">activity</em> means we prefer to keep in motion and keep busy. We enjoy the how of doing things and get energized by being in motion and getting things done. Those of us with a preference for activity don’t often focus on our own emotions, instead turning our attention to tasks and the actions needed to complete them.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">time</em> means that we focus on how long something will take, how long we will remain in a location or when will we return. “Time is money” is a belief that people usually hold when they have this preference. These people are often always aware of the day, date, and time.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">information</em> means we seek out scenarios where we can learn new facts and concepts and figure out how we can apply this new knowledge. We are less concerned with who we are with and where we are as we learn new information, and are more focused on the source of the information and how to apply our new lessons.</p><p id="Par55" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">A preference for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">systems</em> means we like to look at processes and the interconnected nature of things. We look for cause and effect and how things function, even when those systems are human systems. People with a preference for systems tend to think big picture, and can easily see how all the nuanced details fit together and impact one another.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">The final meta-program describes where we mainly focus on our attention as we go through life.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm18">Attention</span>: Self or Other</h4><p id="Par57" class="Para">I introduced the Attention meta-program (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">12-6</a></span>) in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span> as an example of tuning meta-programs. As we move through the world we process information, relate to people, and perform actions. The Attention meta-program determines whether we focus on our own thoughts, feelings, and choices as we go through life (self), or focus on other people’s thoughts, feelings, and choices (other). Because this meta-program fundamentally determines whether our priority is to attend to our self or to others, it is critical when determining what is important to us. If a person is wired strongly toward others, they will struggle to complete the self-reflection questions in this book without involving someone else to assist them. Equally, a person strongly wired for self may have a more limited view of themselves and capacities as they only process their singular perspective.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.42em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 12-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">Attention meta-program</span></h6></div><p id="Par58" class="Para">As you can imagine, balance in the Attention meta-program (the ability to focus on both self and other) is critical for successful leadership. If we have a strong preference at either end of the spectrum, it often leads to unnecessary challenges, especially around team engagement, building a compelling strategy, and communicating with others, for example.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">The final technique we are going to look at to discover what’s important to us is to understand the highest mental frame we are holding.</p></div></div></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The <span id="ITerm19">Highest Frame Governs</span> the Game</h2><p id="Par60" class="Para">Sometimes we know what we want (or at least we think we do) or we know what we want but we aren’t sure why we want it. In coaching, we use a technique that looks for what’s most important to a person by identifying the “highest frame” they are holding in a particular situation.</p><p id="Par61" class="Para">The highest frame can be described as the highest level of meaning we have given to something. This highest frame (or mental view) directs our actions and contains what is most important to us.</p><p id="Par62" class="Para">If you have been in the Agile world for a while, you may have come across the five Whys process, originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda at Toyota Motor Corporation. The Five Whys process is an iterative inquiry process that seeks to find the root cause of a problem. The approach was developed to help get to the cause of a defect or problem in the manufacturing process and has been adapted to the software development world through the application of Lean techniques.</p><p id="Par63" class="Para">In coaching, rather than looking for the root cause of a problem, we follow a similar process to find the highest frame of meaning the person is holding, by asking a similar series of why questions.</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">Here’s a coaching scenario from one of my clients, who we’ll call Jane:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone" id="List3"><li><p id="Par65" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “I’m really frustrated and can’t seem to get motivated by my work.”</p></li><li><p id="Par66" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Coach</strong>: “Why?”</p></li><li><p id="Par67" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “Because my boss won’t promote me and I really want to move up to a Director role.”</p></li><li><p id="Par68" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Coach</strong>: “Why?”</p></li><li><p id="Par69" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “Because I really need to earn more money.”</p></li><li><p id="Par70" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Coach</strong>: “Why?”</p></li><li><p id="Par71" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “Because I really value family and I want to have a baby. Having said that, I don’t think I could take time off from this job.”</p></li><li><p id="Par72" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Coach</strong>: “Why?”</p></li><li><p id="Par73" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “I don’t think my boss would support me if I focused on my family more.”</p></li><li><p id="Par74" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Coach</strong>: “Why?”</p></li><li><p id="Par75" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Jane</strong>: “Actually, I’m frustrated because I don’t feel like my values align with the organization any more, and I probably need to find an organization that better aligns with who I am before I plan for a baby.”</p></li></ul><p id="Par76" class="Para">After this conversation, Jane realized that her and her boss had misaligned values (her highest frame), and Jane’s desire for a family would not be supported where she was. She decided to leave her role and move to another organization and leader that were more aligned with her core values.</p><p id="Par77" class="Para">It can take some coaching skill and time to work through this process, but it’s worth the investment to understand the core motivation driving a behavior.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">In this scenario, it may be that leaving the organization is the best action to take. Alternatively, Jane could have a candid conversation with her boss and discuss her motivations and desire to start a family in order to validate her assumptions (the lack of her boss’s support). Irrespective of the outcome, Jane has gained significant insight and clarity about what is highly important to her.</p><p id="Par79" class="Para">We can apply this process to understanding the motivations and meaning-making of our teams and stakeholders. It is incredibly powerful in one-on-one scenarios in gaining a deeper understanding of what drives a person. However, caution should be exercised when using this process with others. As you might imagine, it’s quite easy for the other person to feel interrogated when being asked “Why?” over and over. In coaching, we tend to ask “and why is that important to you?” or “and what does that mean for you?” instead of just “why?”. (We cover this in more detail in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_16_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">16</span></a></span>.) However, in this chapter, we are applying the five Whys technique to ourselves as a tool to drill down into our core motivations and to help us understand what is important.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm20">Purpose</span>
            </h2><p id="Par80" class="Para">What is your life purpose? Do you know? Is there something that drives you, both professionally and personally? Purpose is essentially our single highest intention that binds together what we value most with all other intentions, creating a complete and single way of being.</p><p id="Par81" class="Para">Elon Musk’s purpose is:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par82" class="Para">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">To make the human race a multi-planetary species.</em>
                  <a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a>
                </p></blockquote><p id="Par84" class="Para">His way of “being” leads him to single mindedly focus all his time and energy into achieving this life purpose. Indeed, what higher purpose can there be than to protect the human race against its potential destruction caused by the limitations of living only on a single planet—Earth.</p><p id="Par85" class="Para">His purpose drives his intentions and prioritizes his energy and attention on SpaceX and Tesla. He knows that every step he takes with these companies takes him one step closer to colonizing another planet, either through the development of space rockets or energy supply and advanced manufacturing techniques.</p><p id="Par86" class="Para">Without a purpose, we go through life mostly doing disjointed and un-related activities—the exact opposite of Elon Musk. You may find this way of life enjoyable and you may not want or need anything else. However, if you feel like something is missing, something to make sense of what you are doing, then defining your purpose can help. Finding our purpose can be a challenging and lengthy process. In my experience, engaging a coach can help you find clarity.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">

At this point you should have a list of these items, some of which may be related to your digital leadership journey and some may not. Now that we have this base understanding, let’s take a look at the four things that are important to all Unnatural Leaders (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">12-7</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig7"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_12_Fig7_HTML.jpg" style="height:19.8em" id="MO7" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 12-7. </span><span class="SimplePara">What’s important to an Unnatural Leader</span></h6></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm24">Purpose</span>
                <span id="ITerm25">
                  
                  
                  
                </span>
              </h3><p id="Par93" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders have a purpose, or at least a basic concept of the impact they would like to have on their organization, their industry, the world, and the human race. Their purpose provides context and the fuel that drives their growth and evolution. Each leader articulates this in their own specific and personal way.</p><p id="Par94" class="Para">As an example, I describe my purpose as:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par95" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">To positively influence the direction of society so that our children and future generations are able to have a high quality of life.</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par96" class="Para">What makes this meaningful for me is that I believe the future is uncertain. With the advent of artificial intelligence and other technical advancements, I believe that our society could head in a number of directions, and some of those directions are ones that I would not want for my children. I believe that the world is ever increasingly being run by technology-led organizations, and as such, digital leaders are the focus of my attention. If I can impact digital leaders, their teams, and their organizations in a positive way, I can build a more positive future and a world I’m happy to leave behind for the children and future generations.</p><p id="Par97" class="Para">My purpose, however, does not limit me to just working with digital leaders. It also drives me to look at the education system and how we raise our children. I am passionate about creating a world where children are given the skills and knowledge to lead a better life through understanding how to run their own brains (using similar tools to those in this book), which in turns generates more compassion in the world and a better future for all.</p></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Our Own <span id="ITerm26">Personal Growth and Evolution</span><span id="ITerm27">
                  
                  
                </span></h3><p id="Par98" class="Para">Unnatural Leadership is about evolving faster than the pace of change. If our growth and evolution are not important then we’ll fill our days with busyness and fail to focus our attention on activities that promote our evolution (for more details see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_14_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">14</span></a></span>). We have to value and embody our evolution and not simply pay lip service to the concept of it. Sometimes our growth can be painful when we fail or receive negative feedback. However, when we value growth and have a growth mindset, we focus on the learning that comes from that setback. Over time, we fear failure and negative feedback less as we come to appreciate it as a fundamental element of our growth and success.</p></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The Growth of Our <span id="ITerm28">People</span><span id="ITerm29">

Nowhere in this book have I defined the role of Unnatural Manager (there are enough of those already).</p><p id="Par100" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders care for and place importance on their people. It’s important to Unnatural Leaders to cultivate environments for their people to thrive, flourish, and grow.

                </span></h3><p id="Par101" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders value people and stakeholder relationships. We understand that people are how things get done and that people are important in every context. Unlike tactical leaders who battle with stakeholders in order to push through their own agendas, Unnatural Leaders value long-term stakeholder relationships that benefit both parties. They can’t help but see the silos (and the unfortunate side-effects of archaic organizational structures) and where possible, they transcend these to create relationships that drive organizational success and impact.</p></div></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Configuration of the Unnatural Leaders <span id="ITerm32">Full Stack</span></h2><p id="Par102" class="Para">Now that we have explored various tools to understand what is important to us as Unnatural Leaders, let’s bring this all together and look at how an Unnatural Leader’s stack is configured.</p><p id="Par103" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders are primarily intrinsically motivated. They clearly understand what is important them and what work is meaningful. This guides and shapes what they do and plays into their highest frame.</p><div id="Sec20" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">An Unnatural Leaders <span id="ITerm33">Backend Configuration</span></h3><p id="Par104" class="Para">An individual’s Enneagram type doesn’t change, even as we evolve, and therefore we aren’t able to reconfigure our core type. (As we discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>, there is no right or wrong Enneagram type.) What Unnatural Leaders do is to clearly understand their Enneagram type at a deep level, and can bring to their conscious awareness the patterns, focus, and motivators that drive them. Unnatural Leaders understand the aspects of their type that power them to success and the aspects that may cause challenges. They align and integrate what is important to fully actualize their potential and the potential of others in their organization.</p></div><div id="Sec21" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">An Unnatural Leaders <span id="ITerm34">API Layer Configuration</span></h3><p id="Par105" class="Para">An Unnatural Leader’s three meta-programs are configured in the following way:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List5"><li><p id="Par106" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                      <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Quality of Life—Being and Doing</strong>
                    </p><p id="Par107" class="Para">Quality of life for an Unnatural Leader is typically biased toward being and doing and away from having. They experience a high quality of life through the experiences they have with people, self-expression, and enjoying the human aspects of life.</p></li><li><p id="Par108" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                      <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Preference—People</strong>
                    </p><p id="Par109" class="Para">As Unnatural Leaders develop their leadership capacity they shift their preference toward people and away from what probably made them successful earlier on in their careers: Activity and Information. This is part of the journey described in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_3_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">3</span></a></span>. Relationships are central to Unnatural Leaders and this is echoed in the people focus of the three elements they identify as important (self, team, and stakeholders).</p></li><li><p id="Par110" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">

Unnatural Leaders are able to hold their attention in the middle of the spectrum and shift to each end as needed, allowing them to define what is important to them while also incorporating what is important to others to create effective team environments and the best outcomes during negotiations.</p></li></ul><p id="Par112" class="Para">What underpins the configuration of the Unnatural Leaders stack is a high degree of focus on people (including themselves). Gaining a deep understanding of how we operate is critical to experiencing a high quality of life and reaching our full potential.
