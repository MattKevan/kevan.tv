After spending some time gaining this experience, we are faced with the decision to either follow a digital leadership career path or remain technical. For some of us, we face this choice over and over as we experiment with both options. There are a number of factors that influence how we make these decisions, including our view of managers and the level of control that we wish to have (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_3_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">3</span></a></span> for details).</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">For those of us who choose the leadership path, we have to make the critical transition from focusing on solving technology problems to focusing on growing people. There are a number of other shifts that are also required, including redefining personal success, becoming comfortable making a decision (versus trying to make the right decision), posing problems instead of prescribing solutions, and moving from having a finite scope of work to an infinite one.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Career Success Pyramid</h3><p id="Par17" class="Para">The transition to leadership can cause anxiety as we try to integrate these shifts and learn new skills—usually on the job.

It can take a number of years to make the transition from a technical specialist to a digital leader, so we must consider what the future holds.

The major trends of the last 10 years (including high-bandwidth, always-on Internet access, and the saturation of smartphones) have changed society and with it the function of technology in organizations. During this time, technology transitioned from being an IT cost center to a “strategic enabler”. As the pace of change continues to accelerate and we move to a digital society, we are likely to see the end of the office block as VR and AR provide for remote team collaboration environments. The rapid adoption of AI will dramatically change how we live and what jobs are available. Before this proliferation of AI, however, we will continue to see an increase in demand for great technical talent that can create the best products for the ever more sophisticated consumer. In summary (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">2-3</a></span>), the digital leaders of the future will a) build organizations that are digital natives, b) integrate and leverage these key technology trends, and c) develop a deep understanding of people (themselves, their teams, their stakeholders, and their customers).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figc_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figc_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.6em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">The three components of the digital leadership of the future</span></h6></div></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">

Even if there were one solution, the pace of change would render it irrelevant very quickly. What is required is a solution that enables digital leaders to evolve faster than the pace of change, where leaders focus on developing a deep understanding of people and ride new waves of change. This is Unnatural Selection (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_6_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">6</span></a></span>), at the heart of which is the evolution helix (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">2-4</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figd_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figd_HTML.jpg" style="height:41.48em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The evolution helix</span></h6></div><p id="Par21" class="Para">The Evolution Helix is a four-step process of Awareness, Intention, Attention, and Reflection, which, when repeated, consistently fuels our progressive development and evolution.

The key reference model to understand people used throughout the book is the Humans as a Full Stack model (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">2-5</a></span>). It’s introduced in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span> and explored further in Chapters <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span> and <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Fige_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Fige_HTML.jpg" style="height:27.98em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-5. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Humans as a Full Stack model</span></h6></div><p id="Par23" class="Para">In order to demystify the complexity of human behaviors in an accessible way (to digital leaders), the model draws the analogy that humans work much like the technical full stack, with a frontend (UI), an API layer, and a backend. In the human model, the three corresponding layers are Actions and Communications, Filters, Values and Beliefs, and Personality Types.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">As we evolve, we develop our capacity to understand and process the world. While these changes occur constantly and in small increments (much like a mature Continuous Delivery process), developmental psychologists have categorized these changes into groups called stages of development. The three key stages of Expert, Achiever, and Catalyst describe (among other things) what is important to us, our capacity to understand the complexity of the world, how we interact with others, and our emotional responses. These capacities increase as we progress from Expert, through Achiever to Catalyst (and beyond). In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>, I discuss these capacities in detail and describe how Catalysts are more able to deal with a world that is becoming increasingly more complex and interdependent.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">Our human frontend impacts the effectiveness of communications between two parties. There are four main communication channels—<span id="ITerm11">Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, and Auditory Digital (VAKAd)—</span>and each person has a preferred channel. If a person prefers the Visual channel, they will want to see (or will present) information in a visual format. People with an Auditory preference want to communicate by talking and listening. Communication can become difficult when the two parties involved have different preferred channels. Effective communication involves using multiple channels to ensure that our message is received with the most impact.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">Behind our frontend communication layer, we have the equivalent of an API layer (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>). In order for our brains to be able to process the world in a coherent manner, our API layer deletes (denies requests), distorts (prioritizes requests), and generalizes (batch processes requests).</p><p id="Par27" class="Para">Behind our API layer, we have a set of meta-programs (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span>) that are equivalent to microservices. Meta-programs are patterns of processing in our brain that we have developed over time that impact how and what we do with the information received in our brains. Meta-programs determine things like the size of information we prefer to process, whether we primarily focus on ourselves or on others, and how we understand or relate to authority. To date, over 60 meta-programs have been identified in our brain’s “software”.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para">Our backend consists of our core personality structures, experiences, and memories that determine how we respond to the information we receive. The Enneagram (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>) identifies nine core personality types or backend platforms. By understanding the nine Enneagram types, human communication channels, and meta-programs, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own motivations and behaviors as well as the people we interact with.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm12">Intention</span><span id="ITerm13">

All too often in our careers, we make excuses as to why we can’t do something—either we are too busy, can’t take the risk, or are avoiding choosing by keeping ourselves frantically busy. These are all choices. When we avoid making a choice, we are still choosing; we are choosing to continue on as we are (and often complaining about it). Unnatural Leaders embrace their power of choice and own their career and their four powers of how they Think, Feel, Communicate, and Act (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_11_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">11</span></a></span>).</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Understand: What’s Important to Us</h3><p id="Par34" class="Para">Now that we have taken ownership, we must get clear on what is important to us at a personal level and what is important to all Unnatural Leaders.

Unnatural Leaders take back control of their calendars and plan their time in order to balance tactical and strategic and delivery and culture. It is important to be aware of how our energy levels vary throughout the day so that we utilize the highest levels to make decisions and be creative. An example performance profile is shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig8">2-8</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig8"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figh_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figh_HTML.jpg" style="height:23.02em" id="MO8" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-8. </span><span class="SimplePara">

Framing is critical to ensure that we are considering the right information, holding the most effective perspectives, and utilizing the most appropriate combinations of the Digital Situational Leadership modes (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">2-1</a></span>). Once we have framed what it is we are working on and why we are working on it, we concentrate on performing and executing to the best of our abilities.</p><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Managing Our State</h3><p id="Par51" class="Para">Outside of the skills, information, perspectives, and leadership modes required to perform well, we must also be able to manage our own <span id="ITerm30">physical-emotional state</span>.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">Negative <span id="ITerm31">states</span> are accompanied by negative emotions (such as shame or guilt) and negative thoughts are less than ideal for high-performance leadership. Energized states, on the other hand, have emotions such as joy, happiness, and elation and positive thoughts that are optimistic, confident, and energizing. The three components that impact our state are our thoughts (internal processing), our emotions (internal states), and our actions (external behaviors). The TEA model, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig9">2-9</a></span>, shows how these three components interact.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig9"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figi_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figi_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.42em" id="MO9" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-9. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm32">TEA model</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par53" class="Para">These three components interact with and influence each other to amplify, create, and change our state.

A great tech brand consists of seven key components, as shown in in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig10">2-10</a></span> (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_15_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">15</span></a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig10"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figj_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figj_HTML.jpg" style="height:22.65em" id="MO10" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-10. </span><span class="SimplePara">The seven elements of building a great <span id="ITerm33">technology brand</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par55" class="Para">The first three elements are visible to potential hires outside the organization and include building innovative and interesting products that have an impact and are commercially viable. All three of these elements are important. Products that don’t have an impact and/or generate revenue are essentially novelties—they may draw the attention of potential hires, but don’t create a brand that top talent wants to become part of.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">Internally within our organization, we do our best to hire smart people, use interesting technology, and solve big problems. When we do this in an empowering culture, we have the four key elements that sustain high performance and satisfaction from our teams.</p><p id="Par57" class="Para">We hold these seven elements in mind as we grow our teams by focusing on developing a deep understanding of each individual, and then coaching them to grow and contribute to the organization. We do this by using the Human Full Stack model to assist our understanding of their personality and motivators and then we build challenging and exciting development plans with them that focus strongly on learning.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">In parallel to paying attention to evolving ourselves and our teams, we pay close to attention to building long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with our stakeholders (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_16_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">16</span></a></span>). As digital leaders, it’s often impossible to develop ourselves and our teams, develop products, grow great cultures, and have the time to maintain strong relationships with every stakeholder. So we begin by utilizing the Stakeholder Relationship map (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig11">2-11</a></span>). This provides a framework from which to identify individual stakeholders and categorize how we need to approach each relationship based on their impact on our role and the current strength of our relationship with them.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig11"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figk_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figk_HTML.jpg" style="height:31.78em" id="MO11" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-11. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm34">Stakeholder Relationship map</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par59" class="Para">Stakeholder relationships that fall in the upper-left quadrant need to be fixed urgently, as the stakeholder could have a significant impact on us and we don’t have a strong relationship with them. Similarly, we can potentially reduce our investment (if we don’t have the capacity) in those in the lower-left quadrant to monitoring and light engagement.</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">As we engage with individual stakeholders, we develop an understanding of what success means for them by asking questions that drive out specific detail about their motivators. It is all too easy to focus on our own success and not take the time to understand our stakeholders. We then wonder why we aren’t able to influence and collaborate with them effectively.</p><p id="Par61" class="Para">When communicating with stakeholders, avoid asking “why” questions that can trigger conflict and instead use “how” or “what” questions, for example “What is it about…? This allows us to gain information about a stakeholder’s opinion or perspective, which builds on our detailed understanding of them. This knowledge allows us to create mutually beneficial outcomes as we co-create and pitch strategies to gain the buy-in and support we need. These strategies communicate the business context and drivers first, rather than leading with technical, jargon-laden requests. The latter usually alienate, not engage, the stakeholders.</p><p id="Par62" class="Para">As digital leaders, we must balance the “right” amount of technical debt. One of the most challenging aspects of this is gaining stakeholder buy-in to pay back the debt already incurred. These conversations usually begin with us asking stakeholders if they would like a new feature delivered or if we can reduce technical debt. A more effective way to do this is to lead with the question, “Would you like feature X delivered, or would you like us to deliver faster?” (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_16_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">16</span></a></span>).</p><p id="Par63" class="Para">It is very important that when things go wrong, (as they inevitably do), we utilize the TEA model to manage our state appropriately and take ownership of our contribution to the problem. Once we take ownership, we switch into problem-solving mode, offering solutions and leading the way forward out of the problem.</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">Managing our attention can be very challenging and it can take some time to develop the skills and systems that bring about elevated performance, reduce stress, and increase the quality of our experiences (and those of the people around us). As we maintain a high level of curiosity and focus on learning, we also reflect on a daily basis on how the outcomes achieved align with our intentions.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm35">Reflection</span> (See Part V)</h2><p id="Par65" class="Para">The final step of the evolution helix is <span id="ITerm36">Reflection. </span>Our goal with reflection is to accelerate the development of our awareness, as we begin another cycle of the helix. Reflection is the fuel for our evolution. We evolve naturally without reflection. However, the pace is considerably slower and it is likely to be less than the pace of change in the world around us.</p><p id="Par66" class="Para">When we take time to reflect, we consider both the past and the future (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_19_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">19</span></a></span>). As we look back on our day or week, we use journaling to keep track of our experiences, lessons, and progress. We journal on a daily basis as we assess our performance and look for insights into ourselves and the world around us. We seek external feedback that allows us to test our assumptions and understand how we are perceived by our teams and stakeholders.</p><p id="Par67" class="Para">Reflection can give us access to different perspectives, which help raise our awareness. Unnatural Leaders create and respond to change by using the Levels of perspective (shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig12">2-12</a></span>) to contextualize everyday activities in the frames of evolving industries, technologies, and societies and, indeed, how what we are doing (or aiming for) impacts the future of mankind.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig12"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figl_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_2_Figl_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.4em" id="MO12" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 2-12. </span><span class="SimplePara">Levels of <span id="ITerm37">perspective</span><span id="ITerm38">

AI’s exponential capability will see an equal exponential adoption across most industries as organizations leverage the scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness of these “robots”. VR will revolutionize the way we live and work as its capability reaches levels that mean we no longer need to be physically present in city office blocks to perform our roles. The outcome of this will no doubt be a redistribution of cities and living accommodations to areas that are more appealing and/or more cost effective. This movement away from cities will dramatically affect society and the economy as the demand for cities and infrastructure wanes. The decline of the concept of the “city” will have a knock-on effect on the service industries that rely on cities and their workers. Digital leaders (and our organizations) must reflect on the future to avoid being disrupted by these changes.</p><p id="Par69" class="Para">Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_19_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">19</span></a></span>, “Reflecting Together,” contains a set of reflection questions designed to stimulate your evolution through deep thinking about your journey so far and reflections on what you have learned by investing time into reading this book.
