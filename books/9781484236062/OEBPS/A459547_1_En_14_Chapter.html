They take ownership of their time and attention and they use intention to devise systems that keep them working on the right things, in the right ways, to achieve success. These systems help them overcome the key challenges of choosing what to work on, holding the right frames and perspectives on the task at hand, and focusing on execution and delivery results.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para"><span id="ITerm1">Unnatural Leaders</span> follow a process of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Choose, Frame, Focus</em> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">14-1</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:8em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 14-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Choose, Frame, Perform <span id="ITerm2">process</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm3">Choose</span>
            </h2><p id="Par7" class="Para">In order to achieve sustained success, we must consciously choose each and every day where we place our attention and what activities we will do and won’t do. To choose well, we need to be clear about our priorities. Our intentions help shape where we focus our attention and what’s important. We must then prioritize the day-to-day tasks in line with those intentions. It sounds simple, but so many leaders get caught up in urgent, unimportant activities<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> that they simply run out of hours in the day to get to what’s really important. As we progress to more senior leadership roles, choosing what we work on becomes more and more critical as the number of things we could work on grows with the scale of our role. Equally, our role may stay the same in a startup organization that achieves tremendous growth—if we don’t grow and keep pace with the organization we will be replaced by a new leader who can operate strategically at scale.</p><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Choosing to Own Our Time</h3><p id="Par9" class="Para">The single most important element of ensuring that we work on the right things is to take ownership of our time—more explicitly taking control of our calendars. Reactive managers let their <span id="ITerm4">calendars control</span> them; they let other people control their time and how they spend it. Depending on your organization’s culture, you may find that meetings magically appear in your calendar and before you realize it a majority of that nice clear week you had disappears into a black hole of back-to-back meetings.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">Take the time to block out portions of your weekly calendar to refresh intentions, prioritize your workload, and create space for strategic thinking. The times you choose for these activities depend on your own natural cadence and are best aligned to the parts of the day when you have the most energy to be creative, make key decisions, and complete tasks. If you have more clarity of thought in the mornings (as I do), your daily performance profile may look something like mine, shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">14-2</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:23.02em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 14-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">A typical <span id="ITerm5">daily performance profile</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par11" class="Para">I am more creative and tend to make better decisions in the morning when my mental capacity is at its peak, and I move to more operational activity in the afternoon as my energy levels get lower. I often have a renewal of energy later in the evening, where I process tasks and plan for the next day.</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">Understanding your own personal energy levels is key to planning your day and week. Take some time to reflect on what your profile may look like and how that will help you shape your daily routine.</p><p id="Par13" class="Para">Similarly, we have <span id="ITerm6">patterns and cycles</span> of energy through the week that impact our energy levels. Trying to make serious decisions and think creatively on a Friday afternoon is usually a bad idea for most of us, so try to avoid that when possible. Equally, to get the most out of a week we need to plan what we will work on—either at the start of the week or end of the previous week (weekly plan), followed by some time to assess the week’s progress as the week closes out (weekly wrap).</p><p id="Par14" class="Para">It’s essential to start each day by reiterating your intentions. It doesn’t matter when or where you do this, as long as you spend time before the working day begins. You may have the ability to do this early in the morning at home, or during your commute to work. If you are a leader who gets into the office before a majority of the organization, then you could carve out space then. During this intentional time, review your intentions and your vision, bring them to mind and refresh their clarity. With this renewed spotlight on what is important and where you want to go, overlay your role context, the activities of the day and week and, get clear on any specific areas that you may need to prioritize, adjust, or focus on.</p><p id="Par15" class="Para">At the end of your day—usually at home or before leaving the office—take time to reflect on how the day went, what you did, the outcomes your actions generated, and how aligned they were to your vision of success. (We dive deeper into Reflection, which is Step 4, in Part V of the book.) Also reflect on any points of the day where you felt emotions rising for you. Were there any times that you felt defensive, anxious, frustrated, or excited? What was happening when those emotions surfaced? By simply noting these experiences, we can start to see patterns in our actions and responses to others that help us to take back control of four powers (as discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_11_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">11</span></a></span>).</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">In addition to regular planning and reflecting, dedicating space to focus on <span id="ITerm7">strategic activities</span> is essential. This strategic time allows us to gain a better perspective on ourselves, our role, our teams, and the industry. It’s the catalyst for creating proactive, disruptive waves of change. I consistently found, during my interviews with digital leaders, that those leaders who used a calendar system and allocated time for strategic thinking did not struggle with the stress of trying to balance being tactical and strategic. Conversely, for those who had no system, this balance was usually one of their top three challenges. Carve out strategy time and make it sacred. Decline meetings if you have to—if you can’t decline a meeting, move your strategy time somewhere else in the day or week, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">but don’t lose it!</em></p><p id="Par17" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders organize their time to ensure they plan their weeks, act with intention, and lead strategically.

            </h2><p id="Par22" class="Para">All too often the initiatives that we work on are not framed effectively by their originator. Sometimes they prescribe a solution, other times they pose a problem without any context. Rarely are we provided with enough information to allow accurate decision making and delivery excellence.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders start by understanding the <span id="ITerm11">details of</span> the initiative and the desired outcomes. They then take a step back and frame the activity in the larger context of the organization, seeking to understand: how it impacts other initiatives, any opportunity costs incurred, its impact on revenue or growth, it’s alignment with organizational strategy, its impact on product and engineering roadmaps, and how it might impact culture.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">Finally, once we fully understand the <span id="ITerm12">organizational context</span> we take a second step back and consider the impact on the market and industry verticals. We ask the question, “How might this initiative drive the organization’s ability to lead the market and stay ahead of movement in the industry?”</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">Throughout both of these two steps, we use our understanding of the Human Full Stack to test our own assumptions and those made by others. We seek to understand the personality drivers of the parties involved so that we can make intelligent and effective decisions. Our focus on the human element doesn’t stop there. We calibrate the potential impact on our teams and culture and make that a critical part of our assessments before acting.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">14-4</a></span> shows these <span id="ITerm13">steps</span>—beginning at the bottom with the task specifics and growing outward and upward as we obtain broader context and perspective of the what and why of the task, which allows us to make better decisions on how (or why) to deliver.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.12em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 14-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">

            </h2><p id="Par29" class="Para">One of the major contributors to our underperformance is a negative emotional state. When we feel frustrated, anxious, or stressed, it impacts our ability to make decisions and it saps the energy needed to perform at a high level. Worse still, when we feel stressed, it often creates a cycle of negativity where we get stressed about being stressed!</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">Stress is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">big</em> challenge. <span id="ITerm17">Managing stress</span> is critical to having better experiences and living a longer and more fulfilled life. So, what is stress? There are two types of stress: the stress that comes from our environment, such as the death of a relative, or a leaking roof that damages the interior of our house, and the stress that we create in our minds. What will people think of me? Am I being too directive? Did I get that right?</p><p id="Par31" class="Para">Although we have the ability to control the stress we create in our minds, we cannot control all the external stressors in our environment. The result—stress is unavoidable!</p><p id="Par32" class="Para">In her TED Talk, “How to Make Stress Your Friend,<a href="#Fn5" id="Fn5_source"><sup>5</sup></a> ” Kelly McGonigal (health psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University) shares her research on the negative impacts of stress on our health. The bad news is that stress kills. The good news is that it’s how we mentally process and think about the stressful situations we experience that matters. The meaning that we make of the stress (the frame of mind we hold regarding it) influences our stress levels, sometimes amplifying and maintaining stress levels weeks, months, or years after the event. I highly recommend you invest 15 minutes of your time to watch her talk—it could literally save your life.</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">Often, we associate any level of stimulation with stress. This can lead us to experience stress every day, unless we are fully relaxed on vacation! The stress curve shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">14-6</a></span> is based on <span id="ITerm18">Yerkes-Dodson Law</span>, which is an empirical relationship between <span id="ITerm19">arousal and performance</span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:21.8em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 14-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm20">stress curve</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par35" class="Para">Understanding that not all arousal is stressful and that the right levels of arousal can increase performance is extremely beneficial to leaders. It brings a new meaning and frame of mind to how we feel and helps us manage our perception of stress. Too little stress and we become bored or inactive, while too much stress causes fatigue and exhaustion kick in. There is a level of stress that activates us, making us rise to the challenge and perform at our best. Understanding how that feels and mentally labeling this state as “activated” helps us re-frame our experience and maintain high performance.</p><p id="Par36" class="Para">The magic is in being aware of where we are on the curve at any moment. Knowing your personal stress and activation levels are the first steps to managing stress appropriately.</p><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">

The passion and engagement we feel creates an ideal state to learn. This positive state brings curiosity, openness, and arousal (at the right level) and puts us into what Michael Hall calls a genius state.<a href="#Fn6" id="Fn6_source"><sup>6</sup></a> Here our capacity to learn and retain information is enhanced.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">Now, can you recall a time when you didn’t want to attend a training session or workshop—maybe it was on a subject you had no interest in, or late on a Friday afternoon, or maybe it even pulled you away from getting “real” work done. My guess is that your engagement and participation in the session were low and your retention of information was probably close to your lowest levels.</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">Our mind, body, and emotional state affect our performance, in some instances very dramatically.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">Negative states are often accompanied by negative emotions (such as shame or guilt) and thoughts that are pessimistic, dark, or morbid. Our physical body’s energetic state is usually contracted, heavy, tired, melancholic, or, in the worst case, all of the above.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">Energized states, on the other hand, have emotions such as joy, happiness, and elation. Our thoughts are usually optimistic, confident, and bright, and accompanied by a bodily state that is full of energy and ready to perform.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">So, if our state dramatically influences our performance and experiences, what can we do to manage our state and access the states that are most appropriate for success and life satisfaction?</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The <span id="ITerm22">TEA Model</span></h3><p id="Par44" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm23">TEA coaching model</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">14-7</a></span>), created by Hala Fayad,<a href="#Fn7" id="Fn7_source"><sup>7</sup></a> defines the three components that create our state—our thoughts (internal processing), our emotions (internal states), and our actions (external behaviors). These three components interact with and influence each other to amplify, create, and change our state.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig7"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_14_Fig7_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.42em" id="MO7" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 14-7. </span><span class="SimplePara">The TEA model</span></h6></div><p id="Par46" class="Para">The cycle of the TEA model begins with any of the three components. It may be that we think a particular thought (remembering a positive childhood experience) that triggers an emotion (joy), the emotion then triggers an action (smile). The cycle then continues as the action of smiling triggers further positive thoughts. This process continues until one of the three elements triggers a new state. For example, we might feel a sharp pain in our back (action), which triggers a negative thought that resists the pain, creating anxiety and frustration (emotions), followed by slouched shoulders and a frown (action).</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">In another scenario, we might smell the delightful aroma of coffee brewing in the morning. The smell triggers positive memories (thoughts) of comfort, warmth, and stimulation, which creates the emotions of joy, satisfaction, and anticipation, which gets us out of bed (action) and heading to the kitchen for a cup. Drinking the coffee (action) then reinforces the positive state and the cycle continues.</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">This happens continuously inside us, although not always as dramatically as just described. As we interact with others, we trigger different states in them, as they do in us. I’m sure you will recognize the state of frustration (emotion) when you come into contact with certain stakeholders. Without the stakeholder saying a word, they trigger a thought inside us, which triggers an emotion, which triggers a pensive or defensive state, which may manifest itself physically (such as crossing your arms across your chest, a self-protection mechanism). Consciously or subconsciously, the stakeholder detects this physical change and it triggers a similar, negative internal response in them.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">The environment, including the people around us, are constantly triggering and influencing our state.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">The good news is that now that we understand how this system works, and we have full control over our four powers (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_11_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">11</span></a></span>) (our thoughts, feelings, communications, and actions), we can own and manage our state.</p><p id="Par51" class="Para">The more we are able to do this, the higher our performance and satisfaction levels will be.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par52" class="Para">In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_12_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">12</span></a></span>, I outlined my purpose as “To positively influence the direction of society so that our children and future generations are able to have a high quality of life.” I would argue that a high-quality life is a consistent (not necessarily permanent) series of positive states. Therefore, being able to manage our state directly impacts our quality of life.</p></div><p id="Par53" class="Para">To break a negative state or create a positive one, we need to change our thoughts, emotions, or actions. If we can change two elements at once, we often get a faster, greater state change. When choosing to change state, we usually focus on either changing our actions and or our thoughts—these then impact our emotional state. Let’s take a look at two techniques for changing state. The first method starts with thoughts, the second with actions.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 1: Changing State by Changing Our Thoughts</h3><p id="Par54" class="Para">Reading a good fiction book is a classic (and usually fairly easy) example of changing our state by changing our thoughts. We may sit down to read a book in a <span id="ITerm24">negative state</span>, but as we begin to read, our mind is distracted by the content of the book. The book creates new thoughts as it immerses us in an imaginary world. As we lose ourselves in a “good book,” we experience a fictional reality where our state is shifted by the author telling the story.</p><p id="Par55" class="Para">In a professional environment, we usually don’t have the time or capacity to take a break to read a book. What we can do, however, is acknowledge our negative state, where we are placing our attention and the thoughts that we are having that contribute to this state. We can then choose to re-frame how we are thinking about a scenario. I gave a coaching example earlier where I reframed “politics” to a game of chess, which caused an immediate state shift for the leader to one that was energized and enjoyable. We didn’t change the external environment, just our response to it.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">The other mechanism that I employ with leaders is to transition their thoughts to be curious. Often, our negative thoughts are based on assumptions and judgments of others that cause frustration, anxiety, and anger. When we decide to interrupt these thoughts with a curious mindset that seeks more information and throws away judgment, we can see immediate breakthroughs in our state. Examples of curious questions include: Is it true that…? What if the other person didn’t mean…? Even if I am wrong, what can I learn? Could I have shown up differently to create a different outcome? What context could I be missing that might explain their behavior?</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Method 2: Changing State by Changing Our Actions</h3><p id="Par57" class="Para">Have you ever felt refreshed by going for a walk, run, cycle, or swim? Ever have those “light bulb ideas” moments in the shower? I’m sure you have. Physical movement creates energy in the body and dramatically changes our state—either relaxing the stress levels or energizing us with endorphins. Interrupting our state by changing our physical environment and our actions is one of the easiest ways to change state. What’s fascinating about this mechanism is that it doesn’t have to be a 20-minute run to change our state. Adjusting our posture can have a similar effect. Most of us are aware of the concept of body language and how it impacts the way we are perceived by others. However, fewer are aware that our body language affects our own <span id="ITerm25">emotional state</span>. If you’re in a great mood (positive state), try frowning hard, looking down, slouching your shoulders forward, and generally contracting your body into a protective state. When we make these gestures, it feeds neurological information back into our brain that impacts our state in a negative way. Conversely, by reversing these—opening up our posture, stretching our shoulders back, looking upward, and smiling and moving more—we can elevate our state.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">Most of us in digital spend a considerable amount of time working on our devices (laptops, desktops, mobiles, etc.). More often than not we lean forward toward the screens, our shoulders dropping down and forward, necks, and backs bent as we work. These positions not only put physical strain on our body, they also match the patterns of a negative, stress-inducing body language. Until technology does away with the keyboard and the need to type looking down at our hands, we need to actively manage our working posture to maintain a healthy state and healthy body.</p><div id="FPar2" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par59" class="Para">A simple exercise that you can do to combat this stress-induction is to spend five minutes reversing the posture and stretching out in the opposite direction: Tilt your head back and look up toward the sky, stretch your arms out wide to either side of you, and push your shoulders back. It may look a little awkward, but doing this helps to combat the negative impact caused by the considerable time spent hunched over our devices.</p></div><p id="Par60" class="Para">It takes time and effort to practice state management. Some of the negative states we need to work with have built up over the course of our lives and trigger the TEA (thoughts-emotions-actions) cycle so quickly that we never notice the thoughts that created them; we just feel the negative emotional state. Practice this process. It will be worth it, I promise you!</p></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par61" class="Para">In this chapter we looked at the process of developing high-performance levels by consciously choosing what we work on, managing distractions, framing our work in the most effective way, and managing our state and stress levels.</p><p id="Par62" class="Para">Being able to successfully do any of these will make a dramatic difference in how you execute and what you achieve.
