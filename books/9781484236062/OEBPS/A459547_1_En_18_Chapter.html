I highly recommend that you engage (at least as an experiment) in all three in order to experience the impact that they have. I have espoused their benefits throughout this book and so I won’t be discussing them further in this chapter.</p></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Journaling</h2><p id="Par7" class="Para">How we perform our reflection is less important than ensuring that we actually do reflection and dedicate adequate time and attention to make it effective. Getting into a habit of doing reflection is key to our evolution, and Unnatural Leaders journal their reflections on a regular basis.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm2">journaling process</span> causes us to slow down and think about what is important. As we reflect on our day (or week) to take notes, we are forced to think about the key elements that we wish to record. Notes can be recorded either electronically or hand-written in a notebook. Hand-written notes offer the benefit of increasing the activity levels in the brain’s motor cortex, causing an effect that is similar to meditation.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">For <span id="ITerm3">accelerated growth</span>, I recommend journaling your reflection at the end of each day and then performing a weekly review of the journal either at the end of the week, or the beginning of the next.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">Your journal entries will vary in nature, depending on your communication style and the intensity of your experiences that day. Experiment with recording your reflections in your own way and at the level of detail that feels most appropriate. If you haven’t journalled before you may find the process rather awkward; keep at it and develop a style that works for you. Remember, what we are looking to achieve in our journaling is to develop our awareness and performance over time.</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">Most of us have the ability to make an <span id="ITerm4">instinctive judgment</span> about our own performance. We might reflect on a one-on-one meeting with a stakeholder and determine “that went pretty well, [they] agree with my comments”. This assessment is often more tactical in nature (did I get what I wanted) and doesn’t bring the added benefit of deep reflection. To help drive deeper reflection, I recommend the <span id="ITerm5">structure</span> in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">18-1</a></span> for a majority of scenarios.</p><div id="Tab1" class="Table"><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 18-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">Basic Reflection Structure</span></h6><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p class="SimplePara">Field</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">Notes</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Date/time</p></td><td> </td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Summary of the interaction</p></td><td> </td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">How well did the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">outcome</em> align to my <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">intention</em>(s)?</p></td><td> </td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">Personal insights</p></td><td> </td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">What I am going to do differently next time?</p></td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="FPar2" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par12" class="Para">You can download an electronic copy of this document at <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="https://unnatural.io/link/b181"><span class="RefSource">

It takes time to complete this reflection and in some instances it may be weeks or months before you realize the answers to the questions. Holding the questions in mind on a regular basis will help you to develop a perspective on yourself and others that is evolutionary in nature. This process forces you to constantly seek deeper awareness of what, how, and why events occur and what subconscious patterns you may be running. Sometimes, we need time and space from an event to process it from different perspectives. Going back over your past journal entries and reflecting on your old mindsets can show you patterns where a small tweak can amplify your awareness or performance.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Looking for <span id="ITerm8">Patterns</span></h3><p id="Par34" class="Para">Once a week, take the time to review your journal entries and look for any patterns you can identify. An example of a pattern you might notice is the subtle, negative emotional state when interacting with one of your direct reports or a resistance to dealing with a certain type of task. This emotional response was probably so subtle that it wasn’t immediately obvious to you during your initial reflection and journal entries. However, through review, it becomes clear that the tone of the journal entries related to a particular theme is not positive. As you reflect on the series of journal entries, the root cause of the challenge may become obvious or you may require more time to reflect on the triggers (using the eight questions to assist in your inquiry, if needed).</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">Equally, as we look for patterns in reflection, we may gain new insights into the behaviors of our teams, stakeholders, and other key individuals.</p></div></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm9">Feedback</span>
            </h2><p id="Par36" class="Para">Regular performance feedback (provided by others) is invaluable in developing a more rounded and true image of ourselves and how those we interact with perceive the type of leader we are.</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">At the earlier Expert stage of development, we tend to categorize feedback through our black and white worldview of “right” or “wrong” and “good” or “bad”. When we judge feedback like this, we tend to judge ourselves in the same way—“bad” feedback means we failed and “good” feedback means we did well. When we receive “bad” feedback, it’s easy to jump to judging the provider of the feedback in order to dismiss the validity of what we perceive as criticism.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">The challenge is that “good” feedback feels good, so we want more of it. However, in making a judgment of whether the feedback provided is “good” or “bad,” we subject ourselves to the torment of receiving “bad” feedback. Our interpretation of “bad” feedback usually results in a negative emotional state. This can trigger a harsh internal dialogue of self-blame or cause us to become outwardly aggressive and angry as we try and cope with the unwanted negative emotions we are experiencing. The net result is that we tend to avoid seeking out feedback to avoid the negative emotional cycle, and so miss out on the opportunity of accelerating our growth.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">As our stage of development progresses (through Achiever), we realize the importance of feedback and begin to solicit it from people who we have strong relationships with. These safer relationships allow us to process the feedback and engage in a dialogue about our performance.</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">At the later developmental stages of Catalyst, we develop a real thirst for feedback from as many sources as possible (not all positive). We do this because we appreciate the very subjective nature of feedback. Feedback provided by another person is based on their Full Stack configuration and worldview, and on what they deem to be great and horrible leadership. The feedback provider’s perspective is valid (at least for them), but we understand that it is their subjective view founded on a limited number of professional interactions that we have had with them. As such, we seek to understand their perspective and integrate it with others in order to determine what changes we want to adopt.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1 SectionTypeMaterialsAndMethods"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm10">Practices</span>
            </h2><p id="Par41" class="Para">As we reflect (through our own journaling and from external feedback) we may gain a new awareness of ourselves and the world we live in. This new awareness may provide direct insight into what we could change to perform better, or it may generate yet more questions as we search to understand the world from this new perspective. In either case, for us to evolve, we need to practice a new mode of operation.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">I usually meet with a leader who I am helping transform every two weeks for a coaching session. During these sessions, we use reflection together to develop an understanding of their performance and experience. As a coach, the main part of my role is to facilitate a new awareness that would have been difficult for the individual to see for themselves without considerable time and effort. At the end of these sessions, I provide the leader with a set of practices for the following two-week period (before we meet again). These practices are designed to assist them in developing a deeper understanding of themselves (by bringing their focus of attention to particular areas that they have highlighted as important).</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">If, during your reflection process you identify areas that you’d like to focus on, use the eight questions to facilitate a deeper understanding of (and to gain clarity on) on your intentions. Then, identify your topic and write it down. It might be “Become more aware of my preferred Digital Situational Leadership mode.” As you explore this space, I recommend instigating a practice for two weeks to push you out of your comfort zone while you “try on” different ways of operating. Using the example, a practice might be to operate from a different Digital Situational Leadership mode each two-week cycle and journal daily on the outcomes. Over time, your new awareness of the four modes in this framework will drive you to know what your preferred or default operating mode is. The next practice may then involve understanding (through your new awareness) why that particular mode is your preference. Each two-week cycle evolves and develops both our self-awareness and the awareness of those we interact with.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Future Reflection</h2><p id="Par44" class="Para">As we <span id="ITerm11">journal and process feedback</span>, we do so while thinking about what we want and where we want to go in the future. We ask questions (not always consciously), such as “Is this feedback helping my career? What should I focus my attention on next? What is important to me this week, this month, or this year?” As we assess our past performance and experiences, we do so in order to improve them for the future. That something inside of you that made you read this book is more than likely focused on the future—it’s looking for answers to improve your performance.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">As a digital leader, you are no doubt familiar with the constant evolution of technology and the risk of not keeping pace with (and leveraging) these advances. Are you a leader that’s been playing catch-up? Have you managed to keep up with the pace of change? Or are you a digital leader at the forefront of disruption? Unfortunately, most leaders are doing their best to barely keep pace, sometimes lagging behind and sometimes leveraging new technology to their advantage. Of course, it’s not just a matter of identifying new disruptions; we have to deliver the disruption (or our response to it). For some leaders, that involves creating a new startup that directly targets the disruption, but for a majority of us, it’s getting our teams and organizations mobilized to create (or adapt to) the waves of change.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">We can use the levels of perspective (presented again in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">18-1</a></span>) as a guide to help us reflect on the future, and to improve ourselves and our organization.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_18_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_18_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.52em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 18-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm12">levels of</span> perspective</span></h6></div><p id="Par47" class="Para">We often have a better sense of where we are going at the lower perspective levels of individual and team. To gain similar clarity in the higher perspectives, it can help to think about the larger organization and how the teams, departments, and regions interact, and what trends are occurring within the organization.</p><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Reflecting on the Future of Technology</h3><p id="Par48" class="Para">As a digital leader, we are in the <span id="ITerm13">technology business</span>. We’ve been around technology for most of our lives, with many of us learning technical skills before we landed our first professional job. We’ve already learned multiple technologies, utilized the big trends of our time, and for some of us, we’ve been at the forefront of ground-breaking innovations. Because of this, the technology perspective is usually the most significant and influential perspective digital leaders use, and so this is where we will begin our process of future reflection.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">Some leaders rely on <span id="ITerm14">industry and analyst reports</span> to inform them of the changing and developing trends in the technology world. These reports are used to confirm our insights or catch up on trends we have missed. However, by their very nature, they are usually a historical analysis of what has already happened in the industry, i.e., what disruptive leaders are already doing in the market. Thus, relying on industry reports as a key source for opportunities to create disruption is limited, but not entirely fruitless.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">We maintain an effective awareness of technology trends by constantly absorbing new information about the technology landscape. We do this primarily through our daily conversations with digital natives (developers, leaders, thought leaders) of varying backgrounds and experience levels (graduate developers offer a view that is often a generation apart from senior developers). We interact with tech leaders in our organizations, at conferences and meet-ups, and in other social spheres to expand our knowledge while supplementing our learning with content from the multitude of sources online (Twitter, tech news sites, analysts reports, books, etc.).</p><p id="Par51" class="Para">Even when we engage in these interactions on a regular basis, it’s not easy to distinguish the signal from the noise. Often, new innovations are espoused as the next big thing but fail because the founding team couldn’t deliver a solid product, the product-market fit wasn’t right, or because one or more of the hypotheses made wasn’t valid.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">Equally, some technologies can seem insignificant and yet they become mainstream, with overnight “hockey stick” growth and adoption. Often, this is because the teams involved have iterated (quietly) on a product and found the right market fit, and then made a significant investment in marketing, sighting early adopter success case studies and driving the belief that the innovation really is the next big thing.</p><div id="Sec8" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Reflecting on <span id="ITerm15">3D Printing Technology</span><span id="ITerm16">
                    
                    
                    
                  </span></h4><p id="Par53" class="Para">There are technologies that take years to move from their initial innovation to mass adoption across multiple industries—3D printing is one such technology. The origins of 3D printing can be traced back to over 30 years ago in the early 1980s. However, the technology really developed during the first decade of this century to include the printing of human organs and prosthetic legs. The last decade has seen the proliferation of consumer-grade, DIY, and industrial use of 3D printing. Adidas now 3D prints shoes with their “Futurecraft 4D”<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> line of runners. Construction companies are using 3D printing to “print” houses in concrete in fewer than 24 hours.<a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a> Thingiverse<a href="#Fn4" id="Fn4_source"><sup>4</sup></a> is one of the first web-based platforms to buy and sell 3D printed designs that allow anyone with a 3D printer to print a real object within minutes. As I write this, news has just been announced<a href="#Fn5" id="Fn5_source"><sup>5</sup></a> that we are one step closer to a real world Star Trek Replicator—a device that creates anything we request in an instant.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">Where am I going with all this? Well, as you can see—technology comes in waves. 3D printing eventuated decades ago. It went mainstream (consumerized) around 10 years ago, and more recently we are seeing the technology being developed to a level where it’s applicable across a huge number of industries, from organ printing to footwear, furniture to houses. For some of these industries, it is likely to revolutionize the production of products by increasing quality, reducing cost of production, and facilitating individual customization of products that weren’t previously possible.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">The net result is that leaders in both digital and non-digital organizations need to reflect on the future of technology. The CIOs, CTOs, and CDOs in verticals such as construction (a non-digital industry) must leverage the technological developments in order to lead and survive in the markets of tomorrow. For those of us in digital verticals, 3D printing provides a new market for digital services (Thingiverse being a great example). Outside of the construction of buildings, 3D printing is likely to change society and the way we buy products. Imagine a world where anything can be 3D printed at home. The impact on current retail models, delivery infrastructure, international shipping, and even the environment would be significant (Catastrophic if we print, use, and dispose of objects or a dramatic improvement if we are able to recycle our goods back into our 3D printers.)</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">3D printing is just one of the current technological developments that has the potential to disrupt multiple industries, societies, and economies. Other developments to consider are:

Some of these advancements are more significant and wide-ranging and if you ignore them, you do so at your peril. The impact of AI (discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>) will impact all industries and society in a significant way. Does that mean we should all pivot our organizations to building companion robots and human-like intelligence? Obviously not! What we <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">all</em> need to be doing is developing our organization’s capabilities in these key areas.</p><p id="Par70" class="Para">Any intelligence (artificial or not) needs to learn. For machines to learn, they need data. Capturing and analyzing data, therefore, is a critical first step that you should have made already. Big Data is now an old term, as is Analytics—both are valuable and essential, just not as cool as AI. Machine learning, until recently, has been a big leap to make for the average organization. Machine learning requires different skillsets, tools, and systems to create value for a business and therefore requires a focused investment of resources to implement it well. The cost and complexity barrier for machine learning is reducing as the likes of Amazon and Google release their cloud-based machine learning platforms, which allow developers to create learning systems that were the sole domain of AI PhD post grads just five years ago. However, AI still requires a capability uplift in organizations and therefore you need to have a strategy in place to build this capability and leverage its competitive advantage. Do you have such a strategy? Do you have AI-specific roles such as Machine Learning Specialist and Data Scientist?</p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Here are some questions to help you and your leadership team reflect on the future of AI in your industry:

It’s not just digital advancements that change society; engineering developments (such as the mass affordability of jet travel) have shifted the very nature of what it means to be a sovereign country and citizen. An energizing debate can be easily instigated by asking a group what it means to be an American (or Australian or British or Chinese)—what does dual nationality mean or imply? The fluid and regular movement of people and products through the reduced cost of transportation has created a global society for those who can afford it. And yet, even with these developments in society there is still an unacceptable number of fellow humans living below the poverty line.</p><p id="Par86" class="Para">So, what are some of the trends and shifts that will have a significant impact on our future?</p><div id="Sec11" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">End of the <span id="ITerm19">Office Block</span></h4><p id="Par87" class="Para">In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span>, I outlined the end of the office block, an event that will dramatically and visibly alter society. Advancements in VR and ultra-fast Internet connections will mean that knowledge workers will be able to work from anywhere. When VR becomes sufficiently advanced, it will be close (and eventually indistinguishable) from working in our offices of today. No longer will we need to commute to cities and work in office towers. Transportation, real estate, restaurants, bars, and even tourism will be impacted. It will take a number of years, but a fundamental shift in how and where we live and work is coming.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">

These companies improve customer experience (through convenience, quality of service, or reduced cost), generating marketplaces that benefit both the supplier and the consumer in a mutual manner. These companies have accelerated their growth to provide equivalent scale services to customers at a pace that is an order of magnitude faster than the incumbents in the same market.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">
                  <span id="ITerm22">Smart Homes, Smart (Driverless) Cars, and Smart Cities</span>
                </h4><p id="Par91" class="Para">The increase in capability and reduction in cost and size of IoT (or connected devices) will drive the technological advancement of almost every aspect of society—three significant ones being smart homes, cars, and cities. Like 3D printing, home automation has been around for decades (I should know—I ran a failed home automation startup back in 2002). Technology and society are now at the point of readiness where products such as Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Echo, and other intelligent sensors and devices are becoming commonplace in main street stores and in our homes. The importance of the smart home market to these big industry players is not to sell consumer grade tech products, but to capture more and more data about how we live our lives, what we like, don’t like, when we are ready to buy, and how we are influenced.</p><p id="Par92" class="Para">As our homes become “smarter,” so do our cities. Technology that makes cities more enjoyable (personalized, relevant delivery of information), environmentally friendly (energy-saving devices), and easy to commute around (parking information, live timetable information, and traffic guidance) improve the experience and the impact on the planet.</p><p id="Par93" class="Para">Driverless cars are likely to have an earlier and as significant impact on society as the end of the office block. In a future society where we are able to instantly summon an appropriate vehicle to take us to our destination, very few of us will own a car. The cost savings of not owning a car that spends 95%<a href="#Fn10" id="Fn10_source"><sup>10</sup></a> of its time doing nothing (but depreciate), doesn’t need a parking space (at home, or work, or at our destination) a garage, servicing, maintaining, fixing (after an accident), insuring, or a license to drive will mean the end of the car industry as we know it.</p><p id="Par95" class="Para">The transportation industry will be dominated by the likes of Google and Tesla (or even Uber), which are currently at the forefront of driverless cars where they manufacture huge global fleets of driverless, AI-driven vehicles. Incumbent car manufacturers who have (so far) failed to respond to this shift will go out of business, as will the service industries that rely on the car industry such as insurers, car dealerships and parking providers. Governments will need to realign revenue generation models to include the loss of on-street and government owning parking, car taxation, and even the loss of revenue generated from speeding fines. The visible landscape will be transformed by the reduction in the number of cars, parked cars, parking lots, houses with garages, and the loss of car dealerships, mechanics, and service centers.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">
                  <span id="ITerm23">Virtual Societies</span>
                </h4><p id="Par96" class="Para">As I complete this book (early 2018), Steven Spielberg is scheduled to release the movie <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Ready Player One</em><a href="#Fn11" id="Fn11_source"><sup>11</sup></a> at the end of March. The movie, set in the future, features a society that lives more in a virtual world than the real one. This virtual world provides endless possibilities and realities where people go to explore and be anything they want. While being a typical sci-fi movie, it does offer a view of the future that I believe we are heading toward. More and more of what we call society will migrate to the virtual world. Organizations that take advantage of this will lead and disrupt economies and societies as geographical boundaries dissolve and reachable markets grow. These virtual world experiences will require seismic shifts in thinking much like the shift the Internet has caused. Is VR mainstream today? Can it sustainably support profitable commercial models today? No! But it will; it is something that digital leaders must consider over the coming years as it evolves what it means for human interaction and connection.</p></div></div></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Facilitating Reflection</h2><p id="Par98" class="Para">As Unnatural Leaders, we are no longer individual contributors. We redefined our personal success to be the success of our teams and the people around us (see Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_4_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">4</span></a></span>). If we are to support their growth and evolution, we must <span id="ITerm24">facilitate and assist</span> them in their reflection.</p><p id="Par99" class="Para">Agile teams hold retrospectives at the end of each iteration (or Sprint), in order to continuously improve their performance. Retrospectives are held by the team and are primarily focused on improving the product development and delivery process by asking questions such as: What do we need to stop doing? What do we need to start doing? What do we need to continue doing? What have we learned? Reflection, however, is a deeply personal and individual process and, as such, complements the team retrospective process.</p><p id="Par100" class="Para">The journaling questions can be adapted for use in a team context (and work well with both Agile delivery teams or leadership teams). The questions provide a deeper, more personal view of team experiences, the subtle, undefined roles each individual contributes, and any potential improvements that can be made. This personal nature requires a level of safety in the team to work well and not make the individuals feel overly vulnerable in their sharing. I recommend that each of the team members work through the reflection process individually to experience it before submerging a full team into a reflection session.</p><p id="Par101" class="Para">When facilitating an individual’s reflection process, it’s advisable to begin by describing what reflection is and the benefits of investing time and effort into it. Sharing our own personal experience with reflection is a great way to create a safe environment for the them to try reflection and for us to demonstrate leadership by example. As reflection is incorporated into the regular activities of their role, we can use our one-on-one sessions to discuss their reflections and any insights they discover. Some of the insights developed can then be integrated into the individual’s personal development plan to power their evolution.</p></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par102" class="Para">Journaling and feedback are two powerful methods that enable us to do deep reflection and raise our awareness levels.

We are then able to review these daily journal entries in order to identify patterns in our operation that were previously hidden to us.</p><p id="Par103" class="Para">Feedback provided by others, either in person or through structured assessments (such as the Leadership Agility 360), allows us to better understand how others experience our leadership.
