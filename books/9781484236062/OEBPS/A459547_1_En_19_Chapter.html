Thank you.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">What is a more appropriate way to wrap up this exploration together than to reflect on the book journey itself? With this in mind, I split this chapter into three sections. In the first section, I share with you my reflections as a digital leader, writing my first book, and holding an intention to make a positive impact on the world. The second section summarizes the reflection process and the third and final section is designed to facilitate your reflections on the reading experience—insights gained, any resistance that you might have felt, and the positive shifts you experienced as you read each chapter and completed the self-reflection questions.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">I hope that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Evolving Digital Leadership</em> has, and will continue to, fuel your personal evolution and that of your people.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">My Reflections on Writing Evolving <span id="ITerm1">Digital Leadership</span><span id="ITerm2">
                
                
              </span></h2><p id="Par8" class="Para">As I reflected on the book-writing process, the main insight that struck me was:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkNone" id="List1"><li><p id="Par9" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Everyone should write a book!</em>
                  </p></li></ul><p id="Par10" class="Para">Writing a book is an intense journey of personal evolution. It’s impossible to write a book and not have to face your demons. No matter what your personality type, values, and beliefs, writing a book forces us to overcome something inside us in order to complete and publish it. It might be that you need to overcome your desire for perfection in order to get something to market. It might be that your pattern of procrastination causes you to put off doing the work required, or the big challenge that many of us face (including myself)—the fear of failure. This fear of failure manifested itself early in my journey because I found myself overly concerned with trying to write a great book that smart, critical thinkers would enjoy, rather than engaging in a more empowering state and enjoying the creation process. What helped me overcome this challenge was my desire to provide something of value to the world and the support and encouragement of my friends and family.</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">My objective was to produce a book of great value to both you (our digital leaders tribe) and your people. I made a conscious decision to buck the trend toward slim volumes and to write a book that would contain a lot of powerful content, to give you value in each and every chapter. I realize that it may take you some time to truly digest, understand, and integrate into your way of being and so I hope you come back to this book (with new levels of awareness) and get value from it time and time again.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par12" class="Para">I’d love to hear any thoughts or feedback you have on the book, either “good” or “bad”.

                  </span></a></span>. Thank you.</p></div><p id="Par13" class="Para">Here are some more reflections I have on my book writing experience.</p><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Focusing Considerable Time and Energy on One Thing Has an <span id="ITerm3">Incredible Amplifying Effect</span></h3><p id="Par14" class="Para">This book is a collection of my experiences, knowledge, ideas, and concepts—most of which were present inside of me long before writing the book. Putting them all into one place in a coherent and accessible manner creates something that is way more than the sum of the individual parts and is incredibly rewarding!</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm4">State Management</span> Is Critical to Completing a Book</h3><p id="Par15" class="Para">Managing physical-emotional state is essential to overcoming challenges and completing the project. There were numerous times when I didn’t want to write, couldn’t write, or got feedback (that I wasn’t ready to hear) that triggered a state that wasn’t empowering. I repeatedly made a conscious effort to sit with an awareness of these feelings and acknowledge them, and continue to work on the book.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">Equally, I found that mornings are when I’m most creative, and so I would develop new concepts or write new content early in the day. The evenings, when my energy was lower, I completed tasks that were more mundane in nature—yet needed to be done. This kept the wheels of progress moving and the mornings free for essential creative work.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Early <span id="ITerm5">Feedback</span> Has Been Exciting!</h3><p id="Par17" class="Para">I’ve shared initial draft chapters of the book and presented some of the concepts at conferences, and the early feedback has been very positive. I’m excited as I reflect on the future and imagine the impact that we might all have as we grow together.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Taking a <span id="ITerm6">Lean-Startup Approach</span> and Interviewing 40 Digital Leaders Was Invaluable</h3><p id="Par18" class="Para">Research for this book involved interviewing 40 digital leaders in order to gather and understand as many perspectives as possible on the journey to successful digital leadership. It took me three full months to complete the interviews, analyze the results, and develop my insights. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Each leader offered something valuable to the process—a perspective, idea, strategy, or even a book reference. There were some dramatic differences in perspective, particularity around what each wanted from this book! This led to the innovation that is TL;DR (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_2_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">2</span></a></span>) and “It’s Not Cheating” (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_21_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">21</span></a></span>). I am really grateful to each and everyone who contributed. Thank you.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Not Enough People Are Thinking Far Enough Into the Future</h3><p id="Par19" class="Para">Throughout the <span id="ITerm7">writing process</span>, I’ve discussed the book’s topics with over 100 people. Upon reflection, I realized that most are not considering how the future will unfold and the true impact of technologies such as AI and VR. People who aren’t thinking about and planning for these trends are likely the ones who will get disrupted. I hope this book stimulates more of us to consider, prepare for, and shape the future in a positive way.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Build, Measure, <span id="ITerm8">Learn</span>: Getting Feedback Is Essential</h3><p id="Par20" class="Para">As I wrote drafts of chapters, I circulated them with peers for review. What amazed me early on was that the same paragraph would be identified as the best in the chapter by one person and the worst by another. I learned to factor in their subjectivity (experience and personality), then I got specific on what they liked and didn’t like so I could decide on a path forward. In some instances, I changed nothing (it never ends well when we try to please all the people all of the time), and in other instances, I went with one perspective. In a majority of situations, I found a way to adjust the paragraph so it had a positive impact on both individuals.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">The Book <span id="ITerm9">Writing Process</span> Is Way More Than “Just” Writing</h3><p id="Par21" class="Para">I had set out expecting writing to be a challenge for me. I hadn’t predicted that the writing component would only be about 50% of the total effort. The other 50% was spent on deciding what goes into the book and what doesn’t, how to structure the book so that it flows both at the chapter level and across the breadth of the book, and how and when to use visuals to minimize learning effort and provide clarity. Book creation is a heady cocktail of logical thinking, creative ideation, and attention to the details. It requires tenacity, the support of others, and incredible patience.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary of Reflection</h2><p id="Par22" class="Para">If you change only one thing by reading this book, I hope it is that you start doing regular reflection. Reflecting and developing an increased awareness of both yourself and others is your evolution. Reflecting on the future raises your awareness to the potential disruptions of society and the human race. Facilitating reflection for your people and teams and creating the positive habits of reflection is an incredible gift to give a fellow human being.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">This is what it means to be an Unnatural Leader—welcome to the club!</p><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Facilitating Your Reflection on Evolving Digital Leadership</h3><p id="Par24" class="Para">You may choose how to approach these questions. They are not structured in a particular sequence. You may find some questions truly enlightening and some may not resonate at all—that’s okay! As you work through them, remember that there are no right or wrong answers, just as there are no right or wrong paths to growth. You will find that if you revisit these questions over time (perhaps coming back after a few years), your answers will change. This is a reflection of your shift in awareness.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">I hope that these questions provide sustained value to you and highlight your own unfolding each time you revisit them.</p><div id="FPar2" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p id="Par26" class="Para">If you want to complete these electronically, you can download a copy from <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="https://unnatural.io/link/b191"><span class="RefSource">
