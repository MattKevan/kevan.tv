              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Pico Iyers, author<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par5" class="Para">You may be a tech lead trying to understand your future career options, or a CTO looking to create and ride more waves, or one of the many roles in between. Whatever role you hold, it’s important that we clarify and establish a shared understanding of digital leadership and discuss what it means to be a leader of technologists.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">There are many different types of digital leadership roles. This variety comes from a function of the market vertical and the organization’s resources, size, and culture. However, one thing is common: all leaders are busy people! We work hard to deliver against “stretch” objectives and maintain high levels of employee satisfaction, while at the same time attending numerous meetings, processing infinite unread emails, and responding to a myriad of unplanned interruptions.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">Juggling all of this successfully requires an awareness of the situation or context. Knowing how the current activity (meeting, conversation, or strategy) relates to the bigger picture, knowing what is tactically and strategically important, and knowing how to respond accordingly is an essential skill.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Four Capacities</h2><p id="Par8" class="Para">So what are the most important <span id="ITerm1">capacities</span> for digital leaders? To answer this, let’s first define success:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par9" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Success for a digital leader involves building a motivated, high-performance capability that tactically and strategically delivers value to customers in a sustainable way.</em>
                </p></blockquote><p id="Par10" class="Para">That is, digital leaders need to be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">tactical and strategic</em> while focusing on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">delivery and culture</em>. The Digital Situational Leadership model represents these four capacities, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">3-1</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figa_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figa_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.45em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Digital <span id="ITerm2">Situational Leadership model</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Tactical and <span id="ITerm3">Strategic</span></h3><p id="Par11" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Development of our strategic capacity is essential if we are to progress successfully from technologists to digital leaders. This isn’t a shift from tactical to strategic; it is a shift <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">from being tactical to being tactical and strategic.</em> In doing so we deliver urgently needed tactical solutions (or hacks) within the longer-term strategic context. Depending on the role and organization, the strategy may exist, or we may be responsible for creating the strategy and getting buy-in on our own.</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">For most technologists, we start off in the lower-left corner, focusing on the shorter-term delivery of a single feature, release, or product. As we develop our leadership skills and explore the wider organization, we understand the business model and its constraints more, until we can look into the future, harness technology trends, and steer the organization as one team. The more strategic we become, as we traverse to the right side of the chart, the more strategy becomes about people engagement and influencing others, ultimately leading to securing funding and engaging teams to deliver.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm4">Delivery and Culture</span>
              </h3><p id="Par13" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">One of the hardest balancing acts digital leaders have to perform is that of building a positive, sustainable culture <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> delivering at speed. Longer-term capability uplift and morale often take time to establish and can’t be done overnight. Delivery needs to happen for all businesses, but pushing through delivery at any cost can destroy culture. The paradox here is that as culture gets destroyed, motivation gets destroyed, attrition rises, and delivery performance evaporates all too quickly.</p><p id="Par14" class="Para">The real kicker here is that cultural decay is quite often a silent killer. It creeps up on organizations and for some leaders the first sense they get is the all-too-late lag indicator of increasing attrition rates. If high attrition rates aren’t bad enough, try hiring new talent when the word on the street is that you have a crappy culture. Welcome to your own unemployment! Great cultures are purposeful, empowering, high performance, and practically self-recruiting.</p></div></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Four <span id="ITerm5">Modes</span></h2><p id="Par15" class="Para">The two axes (Tactical/Strategic and Delivery/Culture) of the Digital Situational Leadership model create four modes of operation, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">3-2</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figb_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figb_HTML.jpg" style="height:32.72em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The four modes of the Digital Situational Leadership <span id="ITerm6">model</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Mode 1 (Bottom-Left): <span id="ITerm7">Get Stuff Done</span></h3><p id="Par16" class="Para">Focusing on short-term delivery. It is in this mode where we act fast and get stuff done. There are times when stuff hits the fan, money runs out, systems break, and strategy and culture simply have to take a back seat for a while. Here we hold those things in the background but focus on execution and delivery as a priority.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">This mode is probably the most important one to be mindful of, as it has its own gravity, constantly pulling us toward it. It feels comfortable, productive, and busy, and is often the mode of those around us. When we choose this mode, we must have an exit strategy. Leaders who remain in this mode will find their ability to lead at scale severely hampered.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Mode 2 (Bottom-Right): <span id="ITerm8">Futurist</span></h3><p id="Par18" class="Para">As technologists, we often enjoy being in this mode—thinking about the future (but looking at it mostly from a technology and delivery perspective) and spending a majority of our time focusing on roadmaps, trends, and planning for greatness. Answers in this space are relatively more concrete than those that involve culture. The challenge of this mode is linking the vision for the future, logically and clearly back to the tactical work that is being done today.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Engaging teams that will be building the future can also be a challenge as we operate with a delivery focus, which tends to see us act as individual contributors, rather than co-creating with our teams.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para">Not performing the futurist role becomes a real issue as we ascend leadership roles. Driving the business and leveraging technology for competitive advantage is essential. Leaders who remain more tactical are often overlooked for more visionary, bigger picture personalities who are able to drive change and innovation.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Mode 3 (Upper-Left): <span id="ITerm9">Friend of the Team</span></h3><p id="Par21" class="Para">Short-term focus on culture means that keeping people happy is a priority. It can also mean we are addressing urgent cultural problems that have arisen and require immediate attention. We may take on a role of fighting and protecting a team or individual when others in the organization are pushing delivery in an unhealthy manner. The trap when operating here is what I call the “Happiness Trap”, where, like children who are given everything they want, are still unhappy and want more. Structure and discipline are required. Saying “no” appropriately amplifies the experience of the occasions when we say “yes”.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Mode 4 (Upper-Right): <span id="ITerm10">Utopian</span></h3><p id="Par22" class="Para">Here we are looking into the future and focusing on building a great culture. Our aim is to create a great, new environment for the great new talent who will love coming to work. Building a future capability is essential for sustained performance. The trick is to integrate our vision of the future back to the current state and connect the two with a strategy that maintains high performance throughout the transition. All too many leaders spend little time in this mode, focusing on the urgent demands of short-term delivery. Great leaders have a people-focused vision and purpose that draws them constantly into this mode. Their vision and purpose drive them to ask meaningful questions about the future and how the organization can positively impact it.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">All four modes are essential to success and all are dangerous if we spend too much time locked in one. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Digital situational leadership requires leaders to understand the current situation and maintain agility to move around the four modes as required.</em> In a particular meeting of stakeholders, ultimate success may mean navigating all four modes over the space of an hour. In another scenario, say a one-on-one meeting, it may mean sitting singularly in one particular mode and focusing our frames and conversation around that. We may find ourselves in situations where it’s not clear which mode is appropriate; in that instance, it’s useful to try on a mode and ask questions related to it. For instance, stepping into the Futurist role could mean asking about future tech trends and their impact on what’s being discussed.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">That said, there is more to becoming a successful leader than integrating these four modes of operation. As we transition to leadership, there are some major shifts that need to happen if we are to become great digital leaders!</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">Some of them are logical and relatively easy to shift to, such as becoming more strategic in operation. Some are intensely difficult and uncomfortable to shift to, such as moving from providing solutions to gritty challenges, to posing questions to your teams.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">The challenges and their difficulty vary depending on your personality, context, and experience, but in my 20 years in technology and leadership development, I’ve seen some common patterns. Conscious of the effect of my own biases, I set out to validate and explore the space further by interviewing over 40 digital leaders, to discuss their journey from technologists to digital leaders.</p><p id="Par27" class="Para">What you are about to learn is a summary of the key shifts identified during these interviews and is based on more than 400 years of combined experience in digital leadership. It’s time to stand on the shoulders of giants!</p></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">From Technology to People</h2><p id="Par28" class="Para">Probably the most significant shift required for leadership success is the shift <span id="ITerm11">from technology to people</span>.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">Coailte Dunne describes this shift as:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par30" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“It’s about technologists coming to terms with the fact that they have to interact with people. The further you get away from technology, the more you are dealing with people. The more responsibility you gain the more you will have to lean into influence, relationships and collaboration to achieve your outcomes.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par31" class="Para">—Coailte Dunne, Agile Coach</p></blockquote><p id="Par32" class="Para">For a minority of us, this shift is a release from the shackles of technical complexity and complex problem solving (our heart was probably never really in the technology). For most of us it’s a transition that takes some time and usually follows a path that is more or less parallel to that of understanding the nuances of Agile transformations. This process is shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">3-3</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figc_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figc_HTML.jpg" style="height:19.32em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm12">journey</span> from technology to people</span></h6></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm13">Technology</span>
              </h3><p id="Par33" class="Para">In the first stages of our career journey, our focus was on technology and building the product the right way. As a developer, we wrote code to solve a problem, refactored it to make it more efficient, secure, or maintainable, and practiced our craft day in, day out. It was beautiful. Then one day, one project, frustration began to set in. Frustration with how things get done around here—the process being followed, the waste, the endless meetings, and the long feedback loops. We may have even had the enlightening experience of “delivering” in a waterfall process. So, as much as we love the craft of building digital technology products, we start to focus some of our attention on the processes being used.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm14">Process</span>
              </h3><p id="Par34" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Here we maintain our passion for tech and start to integrate new process skills. We are now focused on building the right thing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> building it the right way. Enter, the various Agile, lean, and customer-centric movements. As a developer, my passion for Agile came back in 2003 in the UK. I was working on a development team that was introduced to XP practices, a totally new way of working together as a team. As a developer, this shift was initially strange and different, and if I’m honest, a little confronting. There was a lot more conversation to be had and a lot more visibility of what everyone was doing. After getting over the initial hurdle, I loved the empowerment, the clarity, and the teamwork and started to look at the Agile movement as a whole.</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">For me these movements were incredible for one reason: They made life better. They made life better because they reduced the amount of wasted work we did (either as unused features or as a product that simply wasn’t fit for purpose). As technologists, problem solving is our raison d’etre, especially solving problems for other people. We love building products that people use, benefit from, and enjoy. Throwing some work away is a fact of iterative learning and getting a great product-market fit. However, needlessly throwing huge portions away is soul destroying!</p><p id="Par36" class="Para">In the early days of the Agile movement (going back 10 years or more), the Agile transformations focused on the practices and doing of Agile. This was an essential step in both the coach’s and the practitioner’s development. Understanding the practices, trying them, and learning from them together as a team is where the magic is. For those who struggled in this phase, we saw what I call “Lipstick Agile,” where teams would plaster the walls with post-it notes, time a 15 minute stand-up, and run a four-week sprint, all “managed” by a Scrum Master. Eventually teams would learn that it was the intent and outcomes of the processes that were important not the actual practices themselves: that the processes were designed for people. This is why some teams succeeded and some failed, with what looked like the exact same practices. Process really is all about people.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm15">People</span>
              </h3><p id="Par37" class="Para">The final stage of the shift is what we technologists often call the “fluffy stuff”. I often feel that we lose sight of what organizations are. For me, I prefer the label “Organization” to “Business” because of the implicit focus on people, not revenue and profit.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par38" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Organization: “A group of people who work together in an organized way for a shared purpose.”</em>
                  </p><p id="Par39" class="Para">—Cambridge Dictionary</p></blockquote><p id="Par40" class="Para">Or, in other words, an organization is a collection of people, working and interacting together to build products or services that achieve a goal and purpose. How we organize those people directly impacts the effectiveness of the organization. In the traditional command and control structures of days gone by, we could have easily labeled leaders as organizers (or equally dis-organizers).</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">Now, as I’ve said before, this isn’t a generic leadership book, so I don’t intend to delve into organizational design or the difference between a working group and a team. What is important here, for this book, is to point to the fact that building great technology and products is essentially about understanding our customers, teammates, and stakeholders better, so that we can apply our technical smarts more effectively.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">Shifting our attention to focus on people and working with people presents us with our ultimate professional decision point. The fork in the road.</p></div></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm16">Fork</span> Me!</h2><p id="Par43" class="Para">The ultimate technical career question: Do we stay technical, or go down the people leadership route? For some of us, this decision is simple and almost unconscious. We have a strong and clearly defined view of what we want and enjoy. This enables us to progress down one of the paths and never look back. Our clarity often stems from an early childhood exposure to leadership role models, or a passion for technology and solving technical challenges, taking us down the thought leadership or people leadership paths, respectively.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">For others, the path is less obvious. We may avoid or postpone making the decision for a number of years, or traverse back and forth, switching between technical and people leadership until we find a balance that feels right for us.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">So let’s take a look at “the fork” (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">3-4</a></span>) so we can understand the options and decide how to approach them.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figd_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figd_HTML.jpg" style="height:33.8em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The fork</span></h6></div><p id="Par46" class="Para">In most organizations, there are two career development paths: the technical path to thought leader and the people leadership path to CTO. The initial stages of the paths are common, with most of us progressing from technologist to senior technologist and tech lead. After this, the paths fork. If you find yourself on the thought leader path, potential roles include architect, community of practice lead, tech evangelist, and eventually thought leader.</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">For those of us on the people leadership route, the path the may include the following roles: scrum master/iteration manager, product manager, development manager, head of…, and CTO.</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">I’m not someone who focuses on role titles. They are significant for finding your next role via traditional recruitment channels and the likes of LinkedIn. However, there is usually a fair amount of ambiguity in the title and definitions supplied by an organization. Being a “Head Of” in one organization could mean you are genuinely leading hundreds of people, building great products, intelligently developing strategy, and securing budget and buy-in from stakeholders. In another organization, “Head Of” could be more like a politician and project manager, simply passing down an approved budget and delivering a series of projects.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">My advice to leaders who are looking for new roles is to strongly investigate and understand the following two aspects of the position:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par50" class="Para">What does success look like for the role? Over what period of time? With what resources? How will everyone measure success?</p></li><li><p id="Par51" class="Para">Can you work with and respect your boss? Are your styles and approaches sufficiently aligned to enjoy the experience? What can you learn from your boss? This is often one of the keys to respecting your boss.</p></li></ul><p id="Par52" class="Para">Role titles aside, let’s look at how people are influenced down each path of the fork, with us first looking at the influences to stay technical and head toward thought leader.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">
              <span id="ITerm17">Thought Leadership Path</span>
            </h2><p id="Par53" class="Para">The path to thought leadership involves staying more technical than the people leadership route. There are six key influencers that drive us to stay closer to the technology:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par54" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">A strong passion for technology</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par55" class="Para">This may sound obvious, but some of us just love technology. It’s our true passion in life. Our passion outweighs the other motivators, such as the desire for senior leadership status.</p></li><li><p id="Par56" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Enjoy solving problems</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par57" class="Para">Solving problems can be addictive. That’s not to say that those of us who take the people leadership route do not solve problems. Of course we do. The key difference here is that feedback cycles for technical problems are considerably shorter than solving for people dynamics, and technical problems can often be validated with data, metrics, and definitive solutions.</p></li><li><p id="Par58" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">A love for building tangible things</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par59" class="Para">Building products is an art form and creating tangible things is self-expression at its best. Creating products and solutions that we can touch and feel can provide a certain sense of satisfaction. This satisfaction probably drew us to the field to begin with. Building teams and organizations is a lot more, let’s say, “fluffy.” For some us, this just doesn’t feel productive!</p></li><li><p id="Par60" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Poor view of management</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par61" class="Para">This one sucks, it really does! Our poor view of management, or for some, the complete disdain for anyone who doesn’t get hands on usually stems from personal experience of being “managed” poorly. (I’ll postpone the discussion on the difference between management and leadership for a later day. I intentionally use the term “management” here.) The net result is a poor experience of being managed, leading many of us to hold a view of “why would I want to do that to someone else?” This is often coupled with a belief that all managers do is attend endless meetings and send emails.</p></li><li><p id="Par62" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Mastery of the technical craft</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par63" class="Para">If you haven’t read Dan Pink’s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Drive</em><a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> yet, it’s worth checking out. It was the most commonly cited book by the digital leaders I interviewed. In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Drive</em>, Pink talks about the three core motivators of Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Mastery, as you might have gathered, refers to an individual’s desire to master their craft—to dive deep (enough) into the detail and to feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. A person in this state is unlikely to want to progress out of their role until (their view of) mastery is achieved. A more developed explanation of this subject is covered in the Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>.</p></li><li><p id="Par65" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Prefer to stay in your comfort zone</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par66" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Let’s face it, it’s warm, cozy, familiar, and feels like home. If the other motivators aren’t strong enough to move us <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> we have certain beliefs about discomfort, then we will remain solidly in our comfort zone. This isn’t the place to be if we want to evolve faster than the pace of change! It’s not wrong, nor is it bad; it’s just not embracing the growth or evolution required to be a leader in the future. After all, “Outside of the comfort zone is where the magic happens.”</p><p id="Par67" class="Para">Are you feeling anxious because you like your comfort zone, but you want to grow and achieve more? Perfect—this book is for you. Keep reading!</p></li></ul><p id="Par68" class="Para">For those of us who choose the thought leadership route, we may relate to all six of these key influencers, or maybe just one or two very strongly. This is what makes us choose thought leadership.</p><p id="Par69" class="Para">For those of us who don’t relate strongly to these influencers, let’s look at the key influencers that drive us down the people leadership path toward CTO.</p></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">People Leadership Path</h2><p id="Par70" class="Para">The path to <span id="ITerm18">people leadership roles</span> such as CTO requires a passion for technology and digital but usually in a more hands-off manner. Technical people leaders utilize their experience of building products in teams as a foundation to lead and have more impact on what is being built and when. The five key influencers that guide us down the people leadership path are:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List3"><li><p id="Par71" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">To have more control and influence</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par72" class="Para">The single most common reason we choose the leadership path is to gain more control and influence over our work, the products we are building, and the objectives that are being set by the organization around us. “I was just sick and tired of working for idiots” eloquently summarizes what I believe most technologists think!</p></li><li><p id="Par73" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">

It’s a product of society’s conditioning. Ascending the organizational hierarchy is commonly associated with being successful. Conversely, doing the same job for years often implies a lack of effort, commitment, or success. This is changing slowly. Some people have realized that life is about doing the things we love, not what’s expected of us. In other words, intrinsic motivation overpowers extrinsic success.</p></li><li><p id="Par75" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Money</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par76" class="Para">The other primary extrinsic motivator aside from success is the need to earn more money as we move from being young and single, and become a parent perhaps supporting a family of one or more children. As our family grows, the cost to support them grows, as does the size of the family home. For most technologists in big cities, the cost of housing is continuing to escalate at a dramatic rate. Not to mention the cost of nice cars, international vacations, expensive restaurants, gadgets, and clothing! For some of us, this means choosing a path that leads us to the highest bidder for our time.</p></li><li><p id="Par77" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">People leading bias</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par78" class="Para">For a minority of us, the decision to lead is a no-brainer and almost unconscious. We take on internal team leadership roles and are easily promoted. The pattern for us is that we experienced some form of leadership as a child, either as a sports team captain, a Scout leader, or had a parent who modeled leadership for us. We tend to be wired for and focus on people naturally because of this. We understand that the dynamics of getting things done relies on people and their interactions. Those with people-leading bias often have a strong desire to help others.</p></li><li><p id="Par79" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Frustration with cycles of tech</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par80" class="Para">In contrast to the sustained passion for technology that drives some of us to remain technologists, others move away from technology because of one common frustration: we are discouraged by the constant learning cycle required to remain current and on top of our technical game. I’ve personally seen hundreds, if not thousands, of new trends, patterns, frameworks, tools, and paradigms in my time. Some people feel like the underlying problem being solved is on repeat and begin looking for new and different challenges.</p></li></ul></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Deciding Which Path To Take</h2><p id="Par81" class="Para">In summary, it depends on a number of interacting factors as to which path is right for you. Even for those who make the <span id="ITerm19">decision</span> easily and are strongly drawn down one particular path, it doesn’t always work out the way they want it to.</p><p id="Par82" class="Para">Some choose the people leadership path because they love leading. However, the combination of company culture, personalities, and events can create an experience that is less than desirable.</p><p id="Par83" class="Para">Conversely, some people ascend to a leadership role by being great technologists. As they do, they get more and more responsibility and accountability. At a certain point, this added responsibility becomes challenging and uncomfortable and they resign, taking a less senior role in a new organization. The cycle often repeats itself when they are again promoted and have to face their career options and motivators, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">3-5</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Fige_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Fige_HTML.jpg" style="height:20.15em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-5. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm20">Sawtooth Resignation pattern</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par84" class="Para">Some people move back and forth between the thought leadership and people leadership paths for a while as they either experiment to understand their preferred option or are given opportunities that cause them to switch paths. Path switching can be done (and is done) relatively easily in the early stages of our careers as both people leadership skills and technical expertise are developed in parallel. However, eventually we reach an inflection point (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">3-6</a></span>) where, once we pass it, switching to the alternative path becomes quite difficult.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figf_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figf_HTML.jpg" style="height:33.8em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm21">inflection point</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par85" class="Para">This difficulty stems from a lack of expertise of the other track at a senior level, which means we either are no longer technical enough to transition horizontally or we don’t have the leadership experience to do the reverse. We can of course, transition over and downward and take on a more junior role than we currently hold and continue our development from there, much like on transition of the Sawtooth Resignation pattern.</p><p id="Par86" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Ultimately, both paths require interaction with, and influencing, people.</em> As a CTO or thought leader, success means influencing other technologists and stakeholders in effective ways. This means understanding human assumptions, preferences, motivators, and communication styles. Essentially, we must master the soft skills that do not come naturally for many logical thinkers.</p><p id="Par87" class="Para">The primary focus of this book is on evolving our people leadership skills to become Unnatural Leaders. That said, the Unnatural Selection framework contains tools that will enable you to evolve faster and improve your people influencing skills, bringing you to the top of your game.</p></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Other Shifts Required for People Leadership Success</h2><p id="Par88" class="Para">Marshall Goldsmith’s book, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">What Got You Here, Won’t Get You There</em><a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a> introduced the concept that the skills and approach you took to get promoted into leadership aren’t the same ones that are required for you to keep ascending roles and being successful. Let’s have a look at what success means in digital leadership.</p><div id="Sec18" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">From Personal <span id="ITerm22">Success</span> to Team Success</h3><p id="Par90" class="Para">Underpinning all of these shifts is the shift in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">how we define personal success.</em> As a technologist, we are essentially individual contributors. As a leader, if success is a version of our personal contribution, this mindset will hold us back from being a great leader. Great leaders realize that success is about making other people successful; it’s about challenging our teams, supporting our peers, and celebrating their success alongside our own. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The secret to becoming a great leader is redefining personal success and shifting from an individual contributor mindset to a people growth mindset.</em></p><p id="Par91" class="Para">Heroic leadership in the digital world irritates people! We may feel good in the moment (when we get that pat on the back from our boss), but we will pay the price later when poor team motivation and lack of trust reduce our ability to influence.</p></div><div id="Sec19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm23">Finite to Infinite</span>
              </h3><p id="Par92" class="Para">A difficult shift to make is from having a relatively finite amount of work to do (to deliver a product) to an almost infinite amount of work to do (in leading a team). As leaders, we need to be able to prioritize what we and our teams should work on. This increased control and influence can be a heavy burden to carry. It means taking control of our time, prioritizing tasks, and saying no to lots of things and people! Wrapped up in this shift from finite to infinite is the way decision making changes.</p></div><div id="Sec20" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">From Making the “Right” Decision to Making a Decision</h3><p id="Par93" class="Para">As we progress along the leadership path, the <span id="ITerm24">decision-making process</span> moves from us being the expert (needing to make the “right” decision) to us simply making a decision. All too often, technologists search and analyze scenarios, looking for the perfect answer. Experts tend to hold a belief that if they look long and hard enough, they will find the right answer. When we do this as a leader, it can appear to others that we are not making a decision, or that we are stuck in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">analysis paralysis.</em> Great leaders make decisions and experiment wherever they can, reducing large complex problems into a series of fast iterative feedback loops, co-created with the right people in the organization. This brings us to the next key leadership shift, from solutions to problems.</p></div><div id="Sec21" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">From Solutions to <span id="ITerm25">Problems</span></h3><p id="Par94" class="Para">This next shift is the key for leading highly motivated, self-organizing teams. As a technologist and individual contributor, we are used to digging into the details of complex challenges and solving problems. We got paid to do it and we loved it. Have you ever worked for a leader who took that enjoyment away by telling you how to do your job? They probably told you what to build and/or how to build it. Being told how to do your job is demotivating and disempowering. It often does not provide the best solution either. Leaders inevitably get pulled away from the minutiae of the product teams, and so we should. But this distance impacts our ability (as leaders) to provide the best solution. It’s a lose, lose situation: we end up with a poor solution and poor team engagement.</p><p id="Par95" class="Para">Leaders often ask me how to best lead Agile teams. They complain that their teams don’t want them to “control” and “dictate,” because Agile teams are self-organizing. Yes and no. Agile teams are self-organizing—however, they are organized around a specific problem (or set of problems) that has constraints (time, money, brand alignment, security, etc.). An aspect of Agile leadership is providing the boundaries for self-organization, while posing problems for teams to solve (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">3-7</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig7"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figg_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_3_Figg_HTML.jpg" style="height:22.53em" id="MO7" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 3-7. </span><span class="SimplePara">Leading <span id="ITerm26">self organization teams</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par96" class="Para">This is conceptually simple to understand. The challenge occurs when we are pressured by our own leaders and stakeholders to deliver. We may know (what we believe to be) the best solution for our team to take, but they either can’t see it or are taking “too long to find it”. The temptation is to jump in and solve the problem (just this once) to get the delivery done. The questions we have to ask ourselves are: What is most important? How might we balance the growth and empowerment of our teams versus faster tactical delivery?</p></div><div id="Sec22" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">These Leadership Shifts Cause <span id="ITerm27">Anxiety</span></h3><p id="Par97" class="Para">Fear of being incompetent is common for technologists. Having spent our careers mastering our craft and demonstrating competence, the shift into leadership throws us into a new environment where we have to start learning a whole new skillset—one that probably doesn’t come naturally to our logical brains. This anxiety is quite normal. What’s different in the world of technology is that technologists don’t typically talk about their challenges. They struggle on, trying to think their way through, or keeping busy building products while avoiding the people challenges. It seems to me that getting technologists to talk about anxiety is a lot like getting men to talk about emotions! That shouldn’t be much of surprise, really, given that the tech industry still suffers from a huge male majority, and anxiety is an emotion.</p><p id="Par98" class="Para">This anxiety spans more than just the initial steps of the leadership journey. During my interviews, it was common for digital leaders to share how they quietly struggled through their careers trying to answer the following questions: How do I think about my career? What mental models do I use? What decisions do I have to make and when? Is a leadership career right for me or should I stay technical?</p><p id="Par99" class="Para">I believe the more we talk about these challenges together, the easier it will become. It is my hope that through this book, we will be able to talk more, share more, and support more. We are all facing the same challenges!</p><p id="Par100" class="Para">In the next chapter, we take a look at the Pyramid of Success: a concise summary of the top five recommendations for a successful for career.</p></div></div><div id="Sec23" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par101" class="Para">Making the transition from a technical role to leadership is challenging for a lot of people.
