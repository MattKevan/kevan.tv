In this chapter we are going to look at the three steps: identifying the right stakeholders, understanding the stakeholders, and positively influencing them (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">16-1</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:7em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 16-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm2">stakeholder process</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 1: <span id="ITerm3">Identifying</span> Stakeholders</h2><p id="Par6" class="Para"><span id="ITerm4">Stakeholders</span> come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. There are senior stakeholders we must “report” to, colleagues who are peers, various people across our organization we must work with, customer stakeholders whose expectations we must meet, and even stakeholders in our industry who have no direct involvement in our business.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">In our digital world, we have the added challenge of dealing with stakeholders who are technical and those who are not (and even those that think they are, but, well… aren’t). Often our stakeholder relationships are hinged around translating technical communications to business communications and vice versa as we coordinate delivery in our teams, across our business, and out to customers. This can be a frustrating experience for leaders who have to repeatedly explain technical and delivery concepts, to the same stakeholders who just don’t understand the unpredictable and complex challenge that is digital product development. Equally, some leaders face the challenge of the “<span id="ITerm5">technical founder</span><span id="ITerm6">
                
                
                
              </span>,” who wrote the original codebase and now, some time later, still believes he knows the best technical solutions.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>, I discussed how our stage of developer (from Expert to Achiever to Catalyst) impacts how we view and approach stakeholder engagement. Statistically, 55% of leaders are at the Expert stage of development. This means they have a tendency to engage stakeholders only when needed and not focus on building long-term relationships. The critical stakeholder shifts that happen as we progress from Expert to Catalyst involve moving away from using our authority to influence, shifting from short-term interactions to long-term relationship-building, and from leaving behind either a passive or assertive style and growing toward one that is balanced and can flex appropriately to the scenario.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">Let’s begin by ensuring we are focusing on the right stakeholders.</p><div id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Stakeholder <span id="ITerm7">Relationship Map</span></h3><p id="Par10" class="Para">We simply don’t have time to build and maintain deep relationships with all our stakeholders. We also don’t have the luxury of not engaging stakeholders who impact our and the organization’s success in a significant manner. More often than not, leaders don’t focus their attention on the stakeholder landscape in order to understand who to engage and how. Unnatural leaders maintain a stakeholder relationship map that visualizes their stakeholders relationship requirements (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">16-2</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:34.82em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 16-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The stakeholder <span id="ITerm8">relationship map</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par11" class="Para">The two axes of the stakeholder relationship map identify the current strength of our relationship with a particular stakeholder (X axis) and the impact that a stakeholder can have on the success of our role (Y axis). These two attributes create a quadrant model that describes how we should be approaching our relationships with the stakeholders in each quadrant.</p><div id="Sec3" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Upper-Left Quadrant: <span id="ITerm9">Fix</span></h4><p id="Par12" class="Para">In this quadrant, we have stakeholders who have the ability to impact our success and who we don’t (currently) have a strong relationship with. It’s advisable then, to engage new stakeholders in this quadrant and strengthen any relationships that already exist. If, for some reason, you aren’t able to engage all stakeholders on your map, this quadrant is where you should focus your attention.</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Upper-Right Quadrant: <span id="ITerm10">Maintain</span></h4><p id="Par13" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">This quadrant is where we want to move people to if they are in quadrant 1. These stakeholders have a great impact on our success <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> we have a strong relationship with them. We need to continue to put effort and attention into these relationships to ensure they remain strong and healthy. When we get busy and distracted, it’s all too easy for stakeholders in this group to drift to the left quadrant, leaving the relationship requiring repair.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Lower-Left Quadrant: <span id="ITerm11">Monitor</span></h4><p id="Par14" class="Para">The lower-left quadrant contains stakeholders who have less of an impact on us, and whom we don’t (currently) have a strong relationship. The guidance I offer for this quadrant is to monitor these stakeholders as you identify them, and keep an eye on the impact they could have as it may change over time.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Lower-Right Quadrant: <span id="ITerm12">Leverage</span></h4><p id="Par15" class="Para">The lower-right quadrant contains stakeholders who we have a strong relationship with, but the stakeholder doesn’t have a significant impact on our success. Here we want to look at any potential opportunities where we can use a relationship to build other relationships (in other words, where can these stakeholders help us build or leverage relationships we don’t currently have).</p><p id="Par900" class="Para">We need to be cautious how much time we spend with stakeholders in this quadrant, as the very nature of the strong relationship-low impact situation implies an enjoyable relationship that we will likely be drawn to.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">To populate the stakeholder relationship map, I prefer to draw the four quadrants on a large piece of paper and populate it with each stakeholder’s name written on a single sticky note. Using sticky notes allows stakeholders to be repositioned as we learn more about them or as circumstances change. I always make sure that I either socialize the map with others (and update it based on their feedback) or co-create it together with a select number of people.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">Sharing your stakeholder map with stakeholders who sit in either the Fix or Monitor quadrants can actively enhance your relationship with them. It gives you an opportunity to discuss why you have placed them in a particular quadrant, and then to discuss your intent (to move them to the Leverage quadrant) and what it might take to build a mutually beneficial relationship together. I imagine that many of you reading this are thinking “No way would I ever do that with Bob (or stakeholder X)!” and so I challenge you to think about what co-creating a relationship with a stakeholder might look like, and how you both could grow through the process.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">And so, maintenance of the map is essential as your role, stakeholders, and the environment evolve over time. The stakeholder map is living artifact that I suggest you revisit at least every month.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Once stakeholders have been categorized, you will need to determine who you are going to focus on and how. Once you have determined this, based on your specific context, it’s time to look at ways of building relationships with these stakeholders.</p></div></div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 2: Understanding the Stakeholder</h2><p id="Par20" class="Para"><span id="ITerm13">Communication preferences</span> are critical for any person to person interaction we have, and stakeholders are no exception. Effective communication (described in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_15_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">15</span></a></span>) is equally applicable to stakeholders. However, with a majority of stakeholders, it’s likely that we won’t have the benefit of explicitly discussing their Human Full Stack. We have to determine their communication preferences primarily through observation. We observe their eye accessing cues (Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_9_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">9</span></a></span>) and use of language such as “look, sounds, or feels” to determine their primary communication channel (VAKAd) and actively listen to the language they use to identify the key meta-programs they are running. A key technique used to develop a deeper and more explicit understanding of an individual is to focus your questions to get into the specifics of a topic. (In the psychology world, this is referred to as “<span id="ITerm14">searching for specificity</span>.”)</p><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Getting Specific</h3><p id="Par21" class="Para">Our language is laden with <span id="ITerm15">generalizations</span>. Generalizations (described in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>) are labels that we use to process information in an efficient manner. However, these generalization can cause confusion and misunderstanding when we use them in our communication. Take this sentence as an example:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par22" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“No, I don’t want to do that—I don’t like cloud platforms.”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par23" class="Para">If a stakeholder made this comment, you might strongly disagree and be tempted to argue their statement—with an equally over-generalized response such as “Cloud platforms are the future; everyone is moving to them”. The “debate” would then likely continue or escalate until either someone “wins” or a stalemate is reached. Usually, both parties walk away from these conversations feeling frustrated and the relationship weakened.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">Conversely, Unnatural Leaders identify the generalized language and get curious about its specific meaning and how the stakeholder formed their opinion. There are two generalizations in the sentence and they are the words: “like” and “Cloud Platforms”.</p><p class="Para"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“I</em> <span class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic">don’t</span> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">like</em> <span class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic">Cloud Platforms</span>.<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">”</em></p><p id="Par26" class="Para">In order to get to the specifics of this communication, an Unnatural Leader might ask the following as a response:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par27" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Q1: “What Cloud Platforms are you referring to specifically?”</em>
                  </p><p id="Par28" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Q2: “What is it that you don’t like about them?”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par29" class="Para">When these questions are posed with genuine curiosity, it is highly likely that the other party will respond positively and honestly like this:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par30" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“I don’t like Source Control Platforms like GitHub because I am worried about security and hosting our IP online where it might get hacked.”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par31" class="Para">Can you see the difference? We now have three further pieces of information (which may or may not be what we had assumed in the first instance). They don’t like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">source control platforms</em> like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">GitHub</em>, because of the potential <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">security risk</em>. This gives us a far more specific and useful understanding of their perspective and their concerns. Their communicated dislike of cloud platforms was a generalization of source control platforms and their perceived security risk. We might also surmise that this stakeholder is more oriented toward the global end of the Cognitive Scale meta-program (see Figure <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html#Fig2"><span class="RefSource">7-2</span></a></span> in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_7_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">7</span></a></span>).</p><p id="Par32" class="Para">We now have more data to inform how we chose to respond and potentially address their concerns. In most situations there will be a level of validity in the stakeholders perspective that, if we acknowledge it, we are likely to foster a higher level of engagement, which in turn surfaces more information and context.</p><p id="Par33" class="Para">Asking for specific detail in the appropriate tone and acknowledging concerns often has the effect of diffusing tension and aggression in the other party. You may have noticed that the two example questions asked for specifics using “What?” rather than “Why?” This was not accidental—rather, there is a specific reason for exploring using questions that avoid “Why?”</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Never Ask Why?</h3><p id="Par34" class="Para">When someone <span id="ITerm16">shares</span> their opinion (or even a judgment), I highly recommend that you do not respond with “Why?” For instance, if a stakeholder communicates the following opinion:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par35" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Windows laptops are the best way to go; we need to buy them for our organization”.</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par36" class="Para">It’s tempting to search for specifics by asking “why?” or even “Why are they the best?” When we we use a “why” question, it triggers the other person to justify what they have said, which causes them to go on the defensive and take a stance ready to argue their position. If we don’t have a strong, positive relationship, the conversation can easily degenerate into a professional “argument,” as they feel compelled to justify and stand by their claim.</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders understand that opinions stated as facts are merely the personal opinions and judgments made by the stakeholder. And Unnatural Leaders know that these are formed by the stakeholders’ own perspectives of reality, values, beliefs, skill levels, and experiences.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">To avoid alienating stakeholders <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> to uncover the specifics of their communication, we ask questions that follow the format of:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par39" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“What is it about X …?”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par40" class="Para">For instance:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par41" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“What is about Windows Laptops that make them the best way to go?”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par42" class="Para">Avoiding asking “why” is a technique I recommend using in most conversations, both professional and personal. Imagine the reduction in household arguments if partners used this approach! Defensiveness and judgment dissipate, and conversations can focus on the meaningful topics that move both parties forward.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">It does take time and practice to develop this habit. Most of us are socially programmed to ask “why?”, we learn it early on as children. It takes cognitive effort to move from “why?” to a question that is structured to ask for specifics using “What is it about that…?”</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Get Clear On What Success Means (To Them!)</h3><p id="Par45" class="Para">Like us, every stakeholder is trying to <span id="ITerm17">achieve objectives</span> in their role. Understanding what stakeholders are striving for and what success looks like for them is critical to building a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">Most stakeholders will happily outline objectives and targets they are delivering to, but we must dig deeper to understand their vision (assuming they have one) for what they want to achieve. We can do this by asking questions such as: “So, in two years when you have met those objectives—what’s next?” or “What’s your longer-term vision for you team/department?” and then based on their response, follow up with “What is it about … that is important to you?”</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">Objectives, goals, roadmaps, and plans are specific to each stakeholder. What helps us excel at interactions with stakeholders is adding our understanding of how their Enneagram type impacts the way they deliver and operate. In Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_10_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">10</span></a></span>, I presented the nine WIIFMs (What’s In It For Me) for each <span id="ITerm18">Enneagram type</span> (shown again here in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">16-1</a></span>).</p><div id="Tab1" class="Table"><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 16-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The Enneagram WIIFMs</span></h6><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p class="SimplePara">Type</p></th><th><p class="SimplePara">WIIFM</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">1 – Reformer</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I do the right thing and change things for the better?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">2 – Helper</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I help someone or the group?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">3 – Achiever</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I be successful?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">4 – Individualist</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I express myself?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">5 – Investigator</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I demonstrate my competence?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">6 – Loyalist</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I support my group’s needs?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">7 – Enthusiast</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can have I have fun?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">8 – Challenger</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I do something that challenges?</p></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td><p class="SimplePara">9 – Peacemaker</p></td><td><p class="SimplePara">How can I find harmony and calm?</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p id="Par48" class="Para">These deeper motivators are not obvious to the average leader. However, they can dramatically affect what the stakeholder is drawn toward at a subconscious level (in most cases even they are unaware of these drivers). For example, a stakeholder who is a Helper (Type 2) may have a set of delivery objectives in which they take a people centric approach and focus on connecting and helping others to succeed. Therefore, to connect strongly with this stakeholder, we must ensure that our communication includes people, and highlights potential opportunities for them to assist us.</p><p class="Para">Success to them really is all about helping people and delivering their objectives.</p></div></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 3: <span id="ITerm19">Positively Influencing Stakeholders</span></h2><p id="Par49" class="Para">The third and final step of the stakeholder process (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">16-1</a></span>) is Influence. Once we have identified our stakeholders and gained and understanding of their preferences and what success means to them, we can positively influence them for mutual benefit.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">How we approach our communication with stakeholders impacts our ability to Influence and gain support. Too many tech leaders approach stakeholder communication with a strong <span id="ITerm20">technical bias</span>—often only including a request for investment in new technology (say backend software stack) and a high-level outline of the features and functionality that will be gained. This is an example of such a request:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par51" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">We propose to move data to AWS, a cloud provider for our data lake and need an investment of $100,000 for the licensing and team to perform the transition. We need to do this because it makes our development process easier.</em>
                </p></blockquote><p id="Par52" class="Para">It’s a basic request (which may have been presented with pretty pictures in Microsoft PowerPoint). It outlines the required investment and a loose explanation of the requirement. Nowhere in the request does it explicitly identify any business benefits, its alignment to organizational strategy, or the business risks associated with not doing it.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para">An organization’s budget is always constrained! When it comes to making decisions on where and how to invest, leaders are always making trade offs between what gets funded and what doesn’t. They want to know that the available funds are being utilized in the most effective manner to grow and sustain the business. Non-technical stakeholders are often not interested in the technical details of a proposal, the question they are often asking (internally) is: “Are you (the technical leader) thinking about the business context and helping to drive the business appropriately with technology”. Unless the stakeholder involved <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">is</em> technical <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> has a sufficient understanding of the domain and problem space, pitching with a technology first request is almost always a recipe for disaster.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">Unlike our <span id="ITerm21">enquiry process</span> earlier where we avoided the use of “why,” when Unnatural Leaders are advocating and pitching strategies we utilize <span id="ITerm22">Simon Sinek’s framework</span>, called Start With Why.<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a> Sinek recommends that we format our communications such that the order is Why, How, and What. Why do we want or need something?, How do we satisfy that need? And with what?</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">In this example, the leader communicated their request in the reverse direction: What technology we want: AWS and the investment: $100,000, How we will do it: With a team, and the why is a poorly articulated technology why: Easier development process.</p><p id="Par57" class="Para">Let’s look at an example of how to increase the effectiveness of your digital pitches.</p><div id="FPar1" class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle1 ParaTypeImportant"><h6 class="Heading">Note</h6><p class="Para">For the purposes of conveying understanding in this book, I’ve written the pitch in plain text. Successful pitches include all three of the main communication channels (Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic) usually in the form of a presentation style workshop.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Why the Business <span id="ITerm23">Needs</span> to Support the Initiative</h3><p id="Par58" class="Para">Start the pitch by describing why the business needs to support the initiative by outlining the current business strategy and objectives, any business challenges being faced and your strategy to support the business. Doing so demonstrates a solid understanding and focus on the business and what it is trying to achieve. An example of this part of the pitch might be:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par59" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Our business is targeting real growth (10x) this year which, when achieved will be mean an increase in customer orders to over 1M per year. Our strategy is to scale efficiently by automating and simplifying our back-end systems to reduce costs by 10% and ensure they can service the higher demand.</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par60" class="Para">Notice that there is no mention of specific technologies or a request at this point. This part of the pitch reiterates a key goal (10x growth) and an identified challenge (capacity of back-end systems). It then outlines how we plan to attack the problem: efficiency through automation and simplification.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">How We Plan to <span id="ITerm24">Address</span> the Business Need</h3><p id="Par61" class="Para">This is where we communicate further details of how our strategy will solve the challenge. Our pitch might continue as follows:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par62" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Server costs and capacity are critical to growth and efficiency. Our current systems will struggle to cope with the volume and would require significant server upgrades to support this. However, if we move to a cloud-based provider with automated monitoring and deployment, we can scale to meet these demands and increase our operational efficiencies.</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par63" class="Para">At this point, we have demonstrated our business focus and outlined clearly how we are going to approach the challenge while achieving the organizational objectives.</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">Where possible, we do our best to align the initiative (and pitch) with the stakeholder objectives and communicate how our proposal benefits them. If we have done a good job at the first two parts of the pitching processes, it’s common at this point for the stakeholder to have already decided to back our initiative. The final step is to outline what we need, and any specific asks we have of them.</p></div><div id="Sec14" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What We Require to Execute and Enable the <span id="ITerm25">Business</span></h3><p id="Par65" class="Para">It’s now time to get specific and provide clarity about the support we require, ensuring that our communication is still business focused:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par66" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">There are a number of cloud providers available of which Amazon Web Services (AWS) meets our required functionality, performance, and security requirements. (See comparison matrix.)</em>

                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The transition requires an initial investment of $200,000 for provisioning and first year hosting fees, a six-person Agile team for three months to complete the migration and an estimated ongoing annual cost of $50,000 (based on our strategic scaling objectives).</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par68" class="Para">The final part of our pitch gets to the specifics that most leaders start with. However, unlike most requests, this request demonstrates that we have modeled the ongoing cost in alignment with the strategic scale required and the attributes we compared to make our decision—the Comparison Matrix.</p><p id="Par69" class="Para">A well thought through and articulated pitch like this demonstrates clear business alignment and is much more likely to gain approval than one that only states the required investment for a specific technology. So the next time you make pitch, remember to start with the business why, then how the request enables those outcomes, before specifying what you will do and the support required.</p></div><div id="Sec15" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Gaining Buy-in to Reduce Technical Debt</h3><p id="Par70" class="Para">As a digital leader, one of the most commons problems we face is managing technical debt. Product development is a delicate balance of building new features and repaying technical debt incurred over time. There are times when it’s sensible to take on an amount of technical debt in favor of validating a business model or customer demand for a product or feature. The trade-off we make at this stage is to favor development speed (allowing for faster and more efficient in market testing) against scalability. (There are some instances where our organization’s size and brand might mean that scalability is in issue from day one.)</p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Digital leaders make and communicate these decisions with their teams and stakeholders. In my experience stakeholders usually respond with comments similar to “well, if we get to that scale, it’s a nice problem to have”. Of course, those nice problems, become mere problems when we achieve scale and they result in technical migrations that involve significant development time and cost.</p><p id="Par72" class="Para">Asking for the ability to carve out large blocks of time from the product delivery roadmap to pay down technical debt incurred is usually a challenging conversation (even for those that approach with a business focused why first). The root cause of this is embedded in the articulation of the request. When pitching for capacity to pay down technical debt (to non-technical stakeholders) digital leaders often make the mistake of asking stakeholders to choose whether they would like the team to deliver new features or stop and fix things (that the stakeholder doesn’t understand). When viewed like this, most stakeholders will push for feature delivery until something dramatic happens in production (system outage, financial transaction errors) that causes sufficient pain for technical debt to become the highest priority.</p><p id="Par73" class="Para">To counter this, rather than asking stakeholders to choose between new feature delivery or stopping to fix debt, a far more effective question is to ask:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par74" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Would you like a new feature delivered or to be able to deliver features faster?”</em>
                  </p></blockquote><p id="Par75" class="Para">When presented with this question, both options sound appealing to a stakeholder. It subtly changes the rather negative frame of technical debt to focus on the business value (the why) of addressing it. I find that explaining the chart in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">16-3</a></span> to be really effective in getting non-technical stakeholders on-board with the value of addressing technical debt.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_16_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:23.55em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 16-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">

                      </span></h6></div><p id="Par76" class="Para">This chart depicts the decrease in productivity as technical debt increases. To the right side of the inflection point (Zone D), technical debt is at a level where the teams are spending more time fixing issues than they are creating new features—until finally technical debt is so bad that the team spends most of their time fixing bugs and errors and there is no more capacity to develop anything new.</p><p id="Par77" class="Para">We want to manage technical debt so that it stays to the left-hand side of the inflection point—ideally in Zone B. Too far to the left hand-side and we enter a warning zone (Zone A), where it’s possible that we are over-engineering features and delivering too slowly for the business to capitalize the commercial value. Too far to the right side and we enter another warning zone (Zone C), which has a gravitational pull toward the inflection point and beyond. Technical debt in Zone C can quickly escalate if left unaddressed and pull productivity levels down past the inflection and into Zone D.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">The chart helps stakeholders understand the relationship between performance and debt. It’s also a tool teams can use to agree and communicate the current state of technical debt in a product. Plotting the current debt level on this chart and talking with stakeholders and teams about the desired technical debt level goes a long way to gaining buy-in and raising the transparency of a challenge that we all face.</p></div><div id="Sec16" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">When It All Goes Wrong</h3><p id="Par79" class="Para">Digital product development is complicated and unpredictable. Things go wrong more often than we’d like! When big things go wrong, stakeholders are impacted and get involved. In some instances they can become angry and/or aggressive. How we respond significantly impacts the severity of the situation and the strength of our relationships.</p><p id="Par80" class="Para">Diffusing tense (or aggressive) <span id="ITerm27">interactions</span> takes skill on our part. We must actively manage our state and remain calm and logical. When dealing with stakeholders who are angry, it’s good practice to allow them to vent their anger. Immediately countering their negative comments can exacerbate the situation. Acknowledging their frustration goes a long way to helping them to diffuse their emotions.</p><p id="Par81" class="Para">Once the emotional intensity has lowered we can then engage in real dialogue with them and explain our position and propose a solution. Where possible we always try to have a solution (or strategy to find a solution) to the challenge at hand. Great executives want ways forward and not denial or shifting of the blame onto others.</p><p id="Par82" class="Para">Managing our emotional state is critical in these situations. It’s all too easy for us to trigger a negative state in ourselves. It’s key to remember that we have full control over our emotional state (our four powers) and so we can choose the most appropriate state for dealing with the interaction.</p><p id="Par83" class="Para">You may be thinking that it’s not my responsibility to manage their emotional state and help them to diffuse their anger. That’s true, it isn’t! However, we aren’t taking responsibility for them and their emotions, we are using our own state management and skills to move to a solution that gets the best outcome for the business and (where desirable) maintains the long-term relationship with the stakeholders.</p></div></div><div id="Sec17" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par84" class="Para">A critical part of successful stakeholder engagement is identifying all the stakeholders we need to engage and focusing the right amount of energy on each relationship. Finding the time to maintain strong relationships with stakeholders can be challenging. However, when we use tools such as the stakeholder relationship map, we can visualize and keep key stakeholder relationships in our attention.</p><p id="Par85" class="Para">Building and maintaining strong relationships involves gaining a deep understanding of how a stakeholder likes to communicate, and using questions to gain a more specific understanding of their opinions, values, and beliefs. We use the same techniques to ensure that we understand what professional success means to them and how their Enneagram type influences the type of goals they set and how the execute toward their goals. This deep understanding allows us to align and, where needed, influence stakeholders to maximize our chance of success.</p><p id="Par86" class="Para">When we pitch strategies to influence stakeholders, we start with the business context and drivers first. This demonstrates the commercial alignment of our proposed solution. We then work backward toward our specific “What” request. We use language that is familiar to non-technical stakeholders and makes explicit the alignment to their (or their organization’s) objectives.</p></div><div id="Sec18" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Self-Reflection Questions</h2><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List1"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par88" class="Para">Populate your stakeholder relationship map.

How we use it and what we focus it on determines both our reality and the level of success we experience. Our intentions help us to focus our attention. However, using a personal system (as suggested in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_14_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">14</span></a></span>) allows us to take better control of our time and prioritize what we do.</p><p id="Par94" class="Para">Framing a problem or scenario and managing our state allows us to respond in the most effective manner with the most appropriate solutions. State management is a challenging skill to develop and those leaders (and indeed, all human beings) that are able to manage their state will experience a higher quality of life and realize more of their innate potential.</p><p id="Par95" class="Para">When it comes to attending to our teams, we develop relationships with our people by gaining a deep understanding of them from the first day they join the company. We then use this understanding to coach and support them in a way that challenges them to achieve their goals and positively contribute toward the performance and culture of the organization.</p><p id="Par96" class="Para">Attention, Step 3 of the evolution helix, is how we execute our leadership role. Some of the things we do will be highly successful, some of them won’t. In some instances we will know why what we did worked and, in others, we will be utterly confused.</p><p id="Par97" class="Para">In Part V, we explore Step 4: Reflection. We look at how to better understand our performance and develop insights that raise our awareness and continue our evolution.</p></div><div class="FootnoteSection"><h1 class="Heading">Footnotes</h1><div class="Footnote" id="Fn1"><p id="Par4" class="Para"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn1_source">1</a> </span>Croydon, UK: Filament Publishing, 2014</p></div><div class="Footnote" id="Fn2"><p id="Par55" class="Para"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn2_source">2</a> </span>Simon Sinek, “How Great Leaders Inspire Action,” TED, recorded September 2009, 17:58, <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="https://unnatural.io/link/b161"><span class="RefSource">
