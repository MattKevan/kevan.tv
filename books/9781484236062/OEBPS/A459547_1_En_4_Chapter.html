              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Sujeet Rana, CTO</p></blockquote><p id="Par4" class="Para">I developed the <span id="ITerm1">Career Success Pyramid</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">4-1</a></span>) with the insights from the 40 plus interviews I conducted with various digital leaders. Although the insights gained were many and varied (giving me enough content for another two books), the following is a summary of the top five most important recommendations. You can address all, or any one of, these in whatever order you choose. However, I urge you to start at the base of the pyramid and lay the foundations for success by owning your career, and then build upward from there.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figa_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figa_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.45em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 4-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm2">Career Success Pyramid</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 1. <span id="ITerm3">Own Your Career</span></h2><p id="Par5" class="Para">Sujeet’s quote at the start of this chapter brilliantly summarizes the starting point of the Career Success Pyramid. Consciously owning your career and owning your decisions is critical if you want to be successful. Yes, luck and opportunity certainly play a part in success; however, the more you focus your attention on what you want, the more it comes into your life.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">If you can’t decide what you want from your career, then experiment, learn, and play. Pick a goal, set an objective, and aim for it. Maybe it’s not the right goal; maybe when you get there you will decide it’s not right for you. That’s okay. Choose something else. Create your career, create your journey, and don’t make excuses. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Success is a place rarely visited by people who see themselves as victims.</em></p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 2. Get a Coach and a Mentor</h2><p id="Par7" class="Para">A coach and a <span id="ITerm4">mentor</span> are not the same thing! Coaches provide you with deep reflections and insights, and like a mirror, they offer yourself back to you. A coach will help you test your assumptions, point you toward your blind spots, and break through your artificially created mental barriers. Successful digital leaders use coaches to shift their awareness, their consciousness, to new levels, and to move them from emotional reactions to logical responses. A coach will challenge you thoughtfully, not emotionally, and will help you tame and even let go of your ego.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">In my experience, leaders who work regularly with a coach, accelerate their development and achieve success faster than those who do not. We will look at stages of development in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_8_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">8</span></a></span>, “Experts and Achievers,” where we will see that once you’re in the adult stages of development, there are no guarantees of progression unless you do the work. You have to set your intention, focus your attention, and reflect. Doing this work with an experienced coach will get you ahead much faster.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">Mentors, on the other hand, are people in your field of expertise (digital leaders) who generally have more experience than you, and they offer direct guidance and advice on tackling specific challenges. Getting the right mentor can be tricky—mentoring (and coaching) requires a good interpersonal fit. Choose a mentor who inspires you, who you respect, and who you are excited to learn from. Always choose a mentor from outside of your circle and certainly from outside of your organization to avoid any potential conflict of interest.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">Crucially, great mentors are well connected and can introduce you to their network of other successful leaders. “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” If you’re interested in the power of networking, check out Janine Garner’s new book, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">It’s Who You Know: How a Network of 12 Key People Can Fast-track Your Success</em>.<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par12" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“The most successful people in rapid growth environments find and leverage support networks.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par13" class="Para">—Victor Kovalev, CTO</p></blockquote><p id="Par14" class="Para">There is a small subset of people who have extensive digital experience and are qualified personal coaches. They can play both roles when working with leaders and organizations, bringing their deep understanding of people to their digital leadership and their knowledge of digital contexts to coaching. Successful digital leaders of the future will have strong coaching skills that enable them to build dynamic, empowering, high-performance cultures.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 3. <span id="ITerm5">Redefine Personal Success</span></h2><p id="Par15" class="Para">I touched on the importance of defining your personal success in the last chapter. It’s a pivotal component of being successful. To reiterate this, I have included some direct quotes from the leaders I interviewed:
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par16" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Leadership success to me is about helping people be more awesome at their jobs and more successful themselves.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par17" class="Para">—James Turnbull, CTO</p><p id="Par18" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Your job is to not be the best engineer; it’s to get the best out of your team.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par19" class="Para">—James Wilson, CTO</p><p id="Par20" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Success is balancing the sweet spot of the business’ commercial goals and respect for your people.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par21" class="Para">—Leah Rankin, VP Product and Engineering</p></blockquote><p id="Par22" class="Para">All these quotes by digital leaders express the same underlying value they place on the success and respect of others. The success of others is integrated into our personal definition of success as we shift our focus from technology to people.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par23" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“ABC. Always be caring! Care about what matters to individuals and care about what matters to the business. Showing that you care is the best thing you can do as a leader.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par24" class="Para">—David Bolton, Head of Engineering</p></blockquote><p id="Par25" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">I’m pretty sure by now (unless you skipped the last chapter) that you’ve “grokked” that people are critical, so I’m not going to labor this point any more. I will add one comment however, and that is: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">You cannot sustainably fake caring about people. If you don’t care for your people, you will never be a great leader. Y</em>ou can’t be a great leader without a great team right there with you.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">Technologists are smart. Too many claim they have poor people skills and a lack of empathy, but they can still identify quickly when their leader doesn’t care about them or the team. Smart people love to learn, and they love to grow. However, that growth is limited when their leader doesn’t genuinely care and support them. It’s easy for people to quit when there is a high demand for talent, and so they do! So if you don’t genuinely care about your people, you might want to sit and think about that for a while. It’s not a black and white conversation either—most leaders will say they care about their people, and they do to a degree, but where does that end? What other things are more important to you? When do you trade off people for something else? Is it appropriate?</p></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 4. Failure Happens, It’s How You Respond</h2><p id="Par27" class="Para">You are going to fail at some point. It’s a fact of life, and it’s a necessary part of becoming a great leader. Failures cause strong negative emotional reactions; these don’t feel good at all. If we process these emotions in a healthy way, they cause us to shift and decide that we are going to change. Alternatively, we may process these emotions and quit. It’s also natural to make excuses and blame others to avoid looking at our own <span id="ITerm6">failures</span>.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Nearly all the leaders in my interviews experienced a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">painful</em> failure at some point. However, in my opinion, what made the great leaders stand out from the rest was that they acknowledged their part in the failure, reflected on what they could do better, and moved to change and grow. Nearly all of them attribute their current success to the biggest shifts they made after a painful failure. I want you to imagine something for a moment. Imagine if you truly, truly believed that every failure meant success. Take a moment to process that. Visualize what it would be like in the moment to know that a failure was a success. Would there be any more failures?</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">Remember: It doesn’t feel good to fail. You probably fear failure (either consciously or subconsciously) because of this conditioned sense of pain, and so screwing up sucks! Looking like a novice sucks. Getting fired sucks. Let this in. Acknowledge your setbacks with self-compassion and then challenge yourself to grow.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par30" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par31" class="Para">—John Powell<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 5. <span id="ITerm7">Balance Leadership</span> and Technical</h2><p id="Par33" class="Para">One of the biggest challenges we face as we progress from <span id="ITerm8">technologist</span> to leader is how technical we need to be. The more senior the leadership role, the greater the pull away from technology. So how, then, do we remain technically competent as a CTO (or any other senior technical leadership role) in order to drive technology effectively? I believe the answer to this question relies on the following three components.
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par34" class="Para">Leadership styles</p></li><li><p id="Par35" class="Para">Size and type of the organization</p></li><li><p id="Par36" class="Para">Passion for technology</p></li></ul><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm9">Leadership Styles</span>
              </h3><p id="Par37" class="Para">How we lead, or more explicitly, how direct we are when leading, is pro­portional to how technical we need to be. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">4-2</a></span> shows the Dictatorship Spectrum. On the left side, we operate in a dictatorial manner and therefore require high technical abilities. On the right side, we operate in an empowering and consultative manner, so our technical ability and currency can be reduced while remaining a high performance technical leader.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figb_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figb_HTML.jpg" style="height:17.25em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 4-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm10">Dictatorship Spectrum</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par38" class="Para">That is, if we are going to prescribe solutions and strategies to our teams, we’d better be great at technology! But this isn’t an excuse to stay technical and directive; that just doesn’t scale to any size. The more people and teams under our leadership, the more consultative and empowering our leadership needs to be.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">In the startup world, the small team size (typically less than 10) often means that the CTO spends a lot of time hands-on. There’s no other way around it; startup CTOs generally need to make a hands-on contribution. Conversely, as a CTO of a large organization, our success is not determined by our hands-on contribution. Our role is to guide and shape longer term, strategic enablement of the business and to grow the technical capability around us to the appropriate <span id="ITerm11">scale</span>.</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">4-3</a></span> demonstrates the combination of leadership style and company size as it relates to technical capability.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figc_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_4_Figc_HTML.jpg" style="height:25.45em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 4-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">Technical direction versus company <span id="ITerm12">size</span></span></h6></div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Size and Type of the Organization</h3><p id="Par41" class="Para">In a small organization, gravity pulls us toward contributing directly, due to the lack of other technologists to build products. As the <span id="ITerm13">organization scales</span>, the leadership aspect of the role forces a shift, pulling us away from the technology. Being directive is required in small startups—it’s how things get done. However, as the organization scales and pulls us away from the technology, we can’t stay technically sharp <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> be a competent leader, never mind a great one. If our style remains directive, we will enter the danger zone. We will burn out, act like a jackass, or slow down delivery performance to a snail’s pace, if not all of the above!</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">As we develop our leadership style away from directive, we consult the technical specialists in our teams for specific input and guidance. Rebecca Parsons, CTO of ThoughtWorks (a global consultancy that has attracted thought leaders such as Jim Highsmith, Martin Fowler, Jez Humble, Neal Ford, and many more), utilizes what they call a Technical Advisory Board (TAB). This board leverages the great minds and thought leadership of their global talent to provide direction and assistance to some of the world’s leading organizations.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">By using a team of highly technical consultants, we can balance people leading and technical input in an appropriate way, leveraging their years of experience with technology and paradigms to challenge and ask questions that reveal the most appropriate solutions for the current context.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">The type of organization (not just the size) also impacts the effectiveness of the technical leader. I define three organization types in descending order of required technical competence and currency:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par45" class="Para">Technical startup</p></li><li><p id="Par46" class="Para">Tech product or consultancy</p></li><li><p id="Par47" class="Para">Non-tech organization</p></li></ul><p id="Par48" class="Para">Quite simply, if we are working for a technical organization, we need to be more technically current than if we work for a non-technical organization.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Passion for Technology</h3><p id="Par49" class="Para">If we don’t have a passion <span id="ITerm14">and</span> love for technology and creation, we won’t make the best digital leader, period. There’s no room in the digital leadership elite for people who a) have not come from a technology background and b) are no longer passionate about technology. Why? Because we are leading technologists. The best people to lead technologists are leaders who were technologists. They know how technologists work. They know when the wool is being pulled over their eyes, and they know what it’s like to be in the trenches.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">If we aren’t passionate about technology, we probably won’t keep abreast of the latest tech trends and therefore will fail to understand both the tool and paradigm shifts happening around our teams. It’s all too easy for digital leaders to get busy and then turn around one day and see that the tech world has moved past what we understood. One can usually date the last time a digital leader was hands-on by the way they approach solutions and the paradigms they use.</p><p id="Par51" class="Para">Passionate digital leaders find time on the train, on weekends, or whenever, to “play” with technology. They seek to understand a new paradigm’s strengths and weaknesses and what it’s like for the teams that use it as a toolset. Great leaders carve out a portion of their week to pair with technologists. Not to guide them, quite the opposite. They seek to learn from the developers. Victor Kovalev, CTO of Redbubble, makes a point of doing this each week with senior developers, to keep current and experience the coal face, the Gemba, where value is created.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">It’s a challenging balance to maintain over time. A lot of leaders feel anxious about their diminishing technical skills, some are drawn back into the technology, and most ebb and flow as a natural cycle of being an agile and responsive leader. Find your balance, understand what’s needed, and be conscious of your technical dictatorship level.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para">The Pyramid of Success provides a concise list of five actions to take if you want to accelerate your career success. Each item is simple to understand and yet presents a particular challenge to how we operate and lead. Part III of this book explores intentionality in detail and explains how to set clear intentions for success. It builds on step 1 of the Pyramid of Success. Part V explores reflection and techniques for the healthy processing of failure.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">Let’s continue our exploration of digital leadership and how it might evolve in the future.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par55" class="Para">Becoming a great digital leader and having a successful career comes down to executing well on the five recommendations of the Career Success Pyramid.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">Paying conscious attention to your career and seeking guidance from a mentor and coach is the most effective way to accelerate career success.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Self-Reflection Questions</h2><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List3"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par58" class="Para">Which recommendation on the Career Success Pyramid do you need to focus on to best impact your career?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par59" class="Para">What is it about the recommendation identified that makes it the most important?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par60" class="Para">How specifically will addressing this recommendation shift your career path?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par61" class="Para">What action(s) do you need to take to make this shift?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par62" class="Para">On average, how would you rate your technical dictatorship level (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">4-3</a></span>)?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par63" class="Para">Do you believe that this dictatorship level is optimal for your current situation?</p></li></ol></div><div class="FootnoteSection"><h1 class="Heading">Footnotes</h1><div class="Footnote" id="Fn1"><p id="Par11" class="Para"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn1_source">1</a> </span>Milton, Australia: Wiley, 2017.</p></div><div class="Footnote" id="Fn2"><p id="Par32" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn2_source">2</a> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Secret of Staying in Love</em>: Thomas More Association, 1990</p></div></div></div></div>
