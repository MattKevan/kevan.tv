                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Intention is one of the most powerful forces there is. What you mean when you do a thing will always determine the outcome. The law creates the world.</em>
              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Brenna Yovanoff<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par5" class="Para">Hollywood movie director James Cameron’s unique combination of technical skills (special effects), artistic flair, and drive for perfection have helped him create the world’s biggest box office smash hits, including <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Terminator 1</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">2</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Titanic</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Avatar</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Aliens</em>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The Abyss</em>.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">What is the secret to his incredible success, time after time? His intention! When creating movies, Cameron’s intention is to “Push the boundaries of what is possible with cinematic digital effects.” Never content with making movies with the current technology, Cameron’s vision often requires the development of new cutting-edge technology that allows him to create realities on-screen that have never been seen before.</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">Intentionality drove Cameron to create the two most successful movies of all time (by box office revenue). The 1997 film, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Titanic</em>, drew in $2.19B globally and won 11 Academy Awards. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Avatar</em> (2009) made over $2.78B worldwide, making Cameron the most successful 3D movie director of all time.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">Both of these movies cost millions of dollars and years to make. Cameron blew <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Titanic</em>’s budget to over $200M (making investors extremely nervous before general release). <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Avatar</em> went a step further, costing $300M in total production costs, and was a work of passion for Cameron for nearly a decade.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">The significant costs incurred for both of these movies came from Cameron’s development of new cinematic technologies. For <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Titanic</em>, Cameron’s directorial vision meant he had to film in the deep ocean depths of the shipwreck. At the time, there simply wasn’t the recording technology available that would withstand the immense pressures of the deep ocean. So he went to work creating it—adding years and millions to the price tag—but Cameron’s intent was so strong, he would not compromise. For <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Avatar</em>, Cameron spent two years developing a new 3D camera system that set the benchmark for all 3D movies to date.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">Cameron pushed the limits of what was possible at the time. Where most directors would have lowered their expectations or compromised the film’s direction, Cameron pushed forward, sometimes dragging his stakeholders with him, and his overwhelming results are more than just dollars or fame—they are tsunamis of change.

                <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">The way James operated hit me hard. It opened my mind to the idea that it didn’t matter what had or hadn’t been done before, or how seemingly insurmountable the task. If you really want something, you go after it.

              </p><p id="Par12" class="Para">—Jessica Alba, Actress<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par14" class="Para">Cameron is a disrupter; he creates the future (his future). He doesn’t wait to ride the waves created by others. His attention and energy are sharply focused by his passionate intention to push cinematic boundaries. Intention has fueled Cameron’s meteoric rise to success.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">What Is Intention and How Does It Make Us Successful?</h2><p id="Par15" class="Para">At first glance, intention is a simple enough word to grasp. The Cambridge Dictionary <span id="ITerm1">defines</span> intention as “something that you want and plan to do”. So what’s the big deal? Why is intention such a critical and challenging part of the Unnatural Selection framework?</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">Well, without intentionality our focus can be pulled in multiple different directions either by external influences or self distraction. Being busy doesn’t mean we are being productive, effective, or bringing into our lives the things we desire. We all have very busy lives, yet few of us are true disruptors.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">Without intention, this busyness can give us a false sense of productivity or can make us feel drained and tired, much like a hamster running endlessly on its wheel that’s going nowhere fast. I’m sure most of us can associate with that hamster-wheel feeling at some point in our lives.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">In leadership, it’s common for our business to be more tactical in nature, and it can pull us toward operating in Mode 1—Get Stuff Done—of the Digital Situational Leadership model. The Get Stuff Done mode is where we spin endlessly on our wheel, dealing with urgent issues, giving in to interruptions, and responding to requests from our teams and stakeholders. If we allow ourselves to stay here for too long, we will soon face poor performance feedback from our leaders, who will likely criticize our lack of strategic, long-term thinking. This may reduce our chances of promotion or even of retaining our current position.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Operating and behaving in this manner is what I call Intention Deficit Disorder.</p><p id="Par20" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Remember this mantra: “<span class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic">Energy flows where attention goes as set by intention</span>”.</p><p id="Par21" class="Para">When we set an intention, it directs where we place our attention. Our energy then goes into the things that have our attention. A clear and compelling intention helps us determine what we do and don’t do. Like a good product vision, intention helps us say “No” and focus on what we need to do to achieve success.</p><p id="Par22" class="Para">Our attention is focused by the intentions we have. If, say, we have the intention to help children develop healthy mindsets, we look at how we might find the capacity to coach and educate them. Our attention is then focused on how we find the time to invest in these activities. In this scenario, we currently spend a reasonable portion of our time each week on household chores and cleaning. With our intention, we able to choose (because we have the income level required) to engage a cleaner to take over these activities to enable us to attend to what we are passionate about.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">Being intentional consists of two steps:
</p><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List1"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par24" class="Para"><span id="ITerm2">
                        <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Setting</strong></span> <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">an intention:</strong> Intentionality requires us to make a choice and get clear on what we want. To do this we need to take time out of our busy day and understand what is truly important to us and prioritize these things. Once we are clear on what is important, we are then able to set intentions that guide us toward what we want to achieve and what we want in our lives. You would be surprised how many leaders do not have a clear intentions. For some of us, this process is challenging. Working with a coach can help us to get clear on the what is important and why.</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par25" class="Para"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">Holding the intention:</strong> Holding the intention is the hard part! By <span id="ITerm3">holding</span> the intention front of mind, it keeps us focused on what we want so that we can continuously make the decisions and choices that keep us on the path to success. Sustaining this over a period of time can be challenging, especially if your organization or your default operating mode is Get Stuff Done. Holding an intention requires us to consciously revisit our intentions and priorities, so that we remain clear on what’s important to us in the longer term, bigger picture.</p></li></ol><p id="Par26" class="Para">Let’s look at a specific example: Have you ever decided to eat more healthy food or lose weight? If you have, you no doubt set an intention for yourself. Let’s assume that our intention is to gain more energy and vitality.</p><p id="Par27" class="Para">As we enter the kitchen to make ourselves dinner, this intention informs the food choices we make. The intention, when powerful enough, guides us to select fresh vegetables and clean foods where previously, we may have been drawn to the pizza. However, if our intention isn’t truly meaningful enough for us, we will be pulled back into your old habits quite quickly.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para">Equally, as we change contexts and head out for our weekly grocery run, our same intention guides the food we buy. After all, it’s hard to eat healthy when there aren’t healthy options in the fridge. Our intention encourages us to make healthy choices and ignore or limit our selection of unhealthy, convenience foods.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para">The great thing about intention is that it doesn’t just work on the conscious, obvious scenarios outlined here. There is an area at the base of our brains called the <span id="ITerm4">Reticular Activating System (RAS)</span>. It’s the part of our brain that does our API-layer filtering. It filters out information that it believes is not important to us. The <span id="ITerm5">RAS</span> determines what is important by what we focus on most. It determines what is important by the intentions we set. So, as we switch contexts to our commute home, we may make the decision to walk home to get some exercise. On our walk home, our RAS filters in the special offers available at the gym on the high street billboards, even though we were not actively looking for them. These adverts were always there, but now with intentionality, our brain is automatically, subconsciously bringing them to our attention.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">So imagine what your career would look, sound, and feel like if you dialed in the intentions that supported your view of success. What would these intentions bring into your world that you have been missing so far? How might your actions, decisions, and behaviors change with new empowering intentions? If you are eager for more and want to find out how to go about setting and holding these intentions, then read on and I’ll show you the Clarity Process. However, if you are unsure or skeptical, take some time to understand where this is coming from. Try asking yourself these questions:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List2"><li><p id="Par31" class="Para">How has being skeptical served you well in the past? Is it appropriate here?</p></li><li><p id="Par32" class="Para">Can you acknowledge your uncertainty and remain open to receiving more information and learning?</p></li><li><p id="Par33" class="Para">What is (or might be) more important to you than reading and implementing the ideas in this book?</p></li></ul><p id="Par34" class="Para">Remember, it’s okay to feel wary, skeptical, and unsure about what I’m saying. In fact, the resistance you may be feeling is a normal part of the self-protection process that helps us avoid the feeling of disappointment in the event of not achieving our goals.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Clarity Process</h2><p id="Par35" class="Para">There are four steps in the <span id="ITerm6">Clarity Process</span> that guide us through intention setting. The four steps are shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">11-1</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:6.95em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 11-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">Four steps of the <span id="ITerm7">Clarity Process</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par36" class="Para">The Clarity Process begins with us owning our career and our choices. Once we have taken ownership and are ready to take action, we need to understand and get clear on what is important to us as Unnatural Leaders. We then need to clearly define personal success and finalize the process by setting our intentions. In this chapter, we are going to explore the first step: Own.</p><div id="Sec3" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Owning Our Career and Choices</h3><p id="Par37" class="Para">Owning our career is the foundation of the Career Success Pyramid (discussed in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_4_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">4</span></a></span>), which is shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">11-2</a></span>. If we don’t own our careers, then no one will. What do I mean by owning our careers? At a fundamental level, it’s about taking responsibility for where we are in our life, planning where we want to go next, and then doing something about it.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:20.78em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 11-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">

Therefore, the way that we process time has an impact on our ability to set future intentions. The Time Zone meta-program defines our preferences for processing time, as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">11-3</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:10.55em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 11-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">

                      </span></h6></div><p id="Par40" class="Para">We all have a preference to focus on either the past, present or future. Planning our careers comes naturally for those of us whose minds are wired to focus predominantly on the future. For some, we look to the future with optimism and enjoy the potential of what may come; for others, our future focus can be more pessimistic and can create anxiety around what may or may not happen.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">For those of us who are wired for experiencing time by being in the present moment or by constantly looking backward into the past, it can be more of a challenge to set and hold a future-focused intention, as our minds are constantly pulling us away from the future. Like the future-focused preference, the past-preference also has positive and negative biases.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">Those of us who process time with a past-positive bias enjoy creating photo albums of our experiences and spending time reminiscing and recalling happy memories. For those of us who have a past-negative preference, we often suffer from regret, guilt, and shame, remembering the things that went wrong, or blaming ourselves for what we did wrong in the past.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">Whatever our memories are, however negative they are, there is nothing that we can do to change the past. All we can do is show up today in the present moment and make decisions that impact our present and future.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">Our goal as Unnatural Leaders (and healthy human beings) is to process aspects of the past that inform and guide us and place a majority of our focus on the present and future. We often have to make a conscious choice to do this. Leadership is about making and owning our choices each and every day, so let’s take a deeper look at choice.</p></div></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Choice</h2><p id="Par45" class="Para"><span id="ITerm10">Choice</span> is a very important and powerful thing. For many of us, we resist “owning” our choices, and instead take the easier route of blaming others for our challenges and mistakes. Choice isn’t just about external events either; choice is about choosing and owning our own emotional state too. Have you ever heard someone say “He makes me so angry!” or “She really wound me up.” The reality is that no other person can “make us angry”. We have to choose to be angry in response to our observations of the other person’s actions and communications.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">I’m sure you’ve experienced one of those days where you are on top form—happy, energized, motivated, calm, and generally rocking it. On those days we hardly even notice the “irritating” actions of certain people, and if we do, we carry on without giving them a second thought. Yet on other days, when we feel tired, grumpy, and stressed, those same people seem to impact us in a significant way. The difference isn’t in what they do; it’s in how we react or respond. Unnatural Leaders are aware of their immediate, internal reaction to a scenario and can cognitively choose a response. This response may be the polar opposite of their initial (emotional) reactions.</p><p id="Par47" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
              <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">When we truly own the choices we make, we no longer have any excuses.</em>
            </p><p id="Par48" class="Para">Let me say that <span id="ITerm11">again</span><span id="ITerm12">
                
              </span>—when we truly own the choices we make, we no longer have any excuses.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">There are no excuses! For most of us, this is extremely confrontational. It means we have a new level of responsibility for our actions and our reactions—and this can feel very uncomfortable. It’s a lot easier to blame others for our current situation, feelings, and responses than it is to own them.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">Try this out now: Think of a current or recent scenario where you become frustrated, angry, or stressed about someone. Did you blame them? Did you respond appropriately? Are you still feeling negative? What would it be like if you owned your state and your response and moved on in a positive manner?</p><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">We Always Have a Choice</h3><p id="Par51" class="Para">Choice can never be taken away from us. As a rather extreme demonstration, consider a scenario where, if I were to hold a gun to your head and tell you I would shoot you unless you stood on one leg, you would still have the power to choose to stand on one leg or not. You may not have any pleasing options, but you do have a choice. Even with a gun to your head, I cannot make you stand on one leg unless you choose to.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">We complain all too often in our roles (and indeed in our lives) that we have no choice, or that we simply have to do something. It might be that our boss directs us to follow a strategy we don’t believe is right and he simply won’t listen. So, we have a choice to make. Once we empower ourselves with the power of <span id="ITerm13">choice</span>, we actually have multiple responses to choose from:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List3"><li><p id="Par53" class="Para">Follows his directives and do as he says</p></li><li><p id="Par54" class="Para">Refuse and quit</p></li><li><p id="Par55" class="Para">Refuse and escalate the situation</p></li><li><p id="Par56" class="Para">Follow his directives calmly and look for another job in the process</p></li><li><p id="Par57" class="Para">Follow his directives calmly and use our longer-term influence on our boss and stakeholders to change direction</p></li></ul><p id="Par58" class="Para">Note. There was no option called “Sucking it up and moaning about how bad our job and/or boss is”. When we own our choices, the need to complain disappears.</p><p id="Par59" class="Para">When we own our choices, we own our four powers.</p></div></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Four Powers</h2><p id="Par60" class="Para">The four powers (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">11-4</a></span>) are incredibly simple to understand. However, I can tell you from my own direct experience of being coached and in coaching others, fully owning all four of them is one of the hardest things to do. Owning them is a continuous, daily process. We don’t simply go through owning our powers once and then we are done. We have to own them each and every day (which is why this is so challenging)!</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_11_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:11.48em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 11-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The four powers</span></h6></div><p id="Par61" class="Para">We have two internal powers that other people cannot see: Our thoughts and our feelings (the left side).

The outcome of this is that we experience failure in areas we might have predicted had we chosen to spend more time thinking about the risks and challenges ahead.</p><p id="Par64" class="Para">How we think is a choice and if we own our power of thought, we take responsibility for thinking the way we do and change it when required.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">

In 1980, Robert Plutchik identified eight basic emotions: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation.

An emotion or e-motion is energy-in-motion—energy that is moving through our body. When we think about the intense emotions, we can often feel the energy in areas of our body.

At the later stages of Catalyst and above, we see emotions as transient states that can be observed as they pass, thus giving us greater ability to choose our response rather than react.</p><p id="Par70" class="Para">You may be familiar with the technique of counting to 10 before responding. This is a technique often used by people at the earlier stages of development to help them control their reactions.</p><p id="Par71" class="Para">Another useful <span id="ITerm21">technique</span> that allows us to respond rather than react is to ask clarifying questions of the other party to test any assumptions we have made. Often our incorrect assumptions are the root cause of our own emotional response. When we enquire at a more detailed level, we can determine if our initial response was appropriate. The questioning process allows us to gain a deeper and broader insight into the person and the context. This enables us to understand the drivers and motivators of the other person and why they communicated or behaved in a particular way. This more detailed and developed perspective regularly generates a level of empathy that tones down our original emotional reaction.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm22">Owning Our External Actions</span>
              </h3><p id="Par72" class="Para">Our actions are our behaviors—the things people can see us do. Internally we think and feel certain things and we make decisions and choices that influence our actions. We may choose to drive over the speed limit (action) based on our desire to get to our destination on time. We make this choice knowing the risks involved in doing so and the potential that we might get caught by the police, or worse still, be involved in an accident. When we own our choice to speed, we take full responsibility for breaking the law and the risks involved. If we get caught, we don’t blame the police officer for giving us an unnecessary ticket or complain about being victimized.</p><p id="Par73" class="Para">Equally, we may have an intention to get into shape, so we make the decision to put in two extra sessions at the gym each week and we follow through. Our actions are a positive move to get to the gym more to achieve our goal. As you can imagine, most of us are very good at owning our positive actions, and not so great at owning the actions that go wrong, or even inaction (which is still an action that involves sitting on the couch and watching TV instead of hitting the gym).</p><p id="Par74" class="Para">Owning our <span id="ITerm23">actions</span> is taking full responsibility for the choices we make and the actions we perform and accepting any outcomes or consequences that occur from them, both positive and negative.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">
                <span id="ITerm24">Owning Our External Communications</span>
              </h3><p id="Par75" class="Para">We have a number of different communication mechanisms. The two biggest ones are verbal (what we say) and nonverbal (our body language).</p><p id="Par76" class="Para">When we own our communications, we own what we say and how we say it. Only 7% of our communication is through words. A further 55% of our communication is through body language, with the remaining 38% being the tone, range, and speed of our voice.</p><p id="Par77" class="Para">All too often I see leaders focus on the words they use and ignore the other 93% of communication and then wonder why we aren’t achieving the influence or impact we want.</p><p id="Par78" class="Para">It’s too easy for digital leaders to resort to emails, text messages, and various other forms of electronic communication out of convenience or when we want to avoid having a face-to-face conversation. This may or may not be an effective way of communicating with the other party (or parties), but owning our communication choices involves us owning the medium we use to communicate and the content and tone of the message.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Owning Our Four Powers Is Challenging and Empowering</h3><p id="Par79" class="Para">Owning all four of these powers, all of the time, is incredibly challenging. To make matters worse, our monkey mind often plays games with us by blaming us for not owning our powers, potentially creating a negative spiral of thoughts and emotions. Being a great leader involves taking risk and trying new things, some of which will fail. Those failures can be very unpleasant to experience. However, a mark of a great leader is to process the failure (and feedback) and grow from the lessons. Great leaders step back up, own their four powers, and then carry on.</p><p id="Par80" class="Para">Paradoxically, ownership of our powers is both challenging and empowering. When we step into full ownership of our powers, we are no longer a victim to anyone or anything. We understand that we can control the way we think and feel and that it is not dependent on our external environment and the people we interact with on a daily basis.</p><p id="Par81" class="Para">Remember, not choosing is still choosing. Often we convince ourselves that there are too many unknowns, or too many options or that we just don’t have time to sit down to plan and make decisions. That is a choice! We are choosing to continue on as we are. We are choosing to stay comfortable, to not address the problem and create a solution. Maybe we’re even choosing to stay miserable and unhappy. Are you starting to see how confrontational the process of owning your four powers of choice can be?</p></div></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par82" class="Para">Setting career intentions and defining a path (whether short or long) is where the magic is. It assists us in combatting one of the biggest challenges to success—distraction. Knowing that we always have the choice of what we do, how we think, and how we feel is incredibly empowering. We can choose a wave to ride or create our own wave. We can then choose to paddle back out for more waves or we can chose to give up and stop. It’s always a choice.</p><p id="Par83" class="Para">The key to making the choices that stick is to align them to what is fundamentally important to us at an individual level. Choices and intentions that don’t propel us to success are often in conflict with other things we value (e.g., watching TV on the sofa instead of going to the gym points to the belief that being healthy isn’t as important as relaxing).</p><p id="Par84" class="Para">In the next chapter, we take a look at Step 2 of the Clarity Process—Understand—and how we determine what we value as individuals and what is valuable to all Unnatrual Leaders.</p></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Self-Reflection Questions</h2><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List4"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par86" class="Para">How would you rate your current level of ownership of your career on a scale of 1-5 (1 being no ownership, 5 being fully committed)?</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par87" class="Para">Assuming you didn’t answer 5 to the last question, what is it that is holding you back from full commitment?
