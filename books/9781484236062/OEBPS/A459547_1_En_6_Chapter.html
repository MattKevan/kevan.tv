              </p><p id="Par3" class="Para">—Viktor Frankl<a href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par5" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm1">Unnatural Selection framework</span> isn’t a prescriptive solution that solves all problems. It is not possible to solve every leader’s challenges—they are too complex and varied for one solution to work. Instead, the Unnatural Selection framework is a process that drives our continuous growth, awareness, and consciousness, enabling us to break through our own unique challenges and to drive change in our lives.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">Evolving faster than the pace of change means shifting our awareness—awareness of ourselves, of others, and of the world around us. This provides access to an expanded array of perspectives and new understandings of our beliefs, values, preferences, and motivations. Awareness develops our perception of time, to see the present day in the context of an ever-expanding past and future. Our worldview shifts from ethnocentric (our local group or tribe), to world-centric, and eventually to cosmocentric (that of the universe).</p><p id="Par7" class="Para">Evolving allows us to understand the personal dynamics of our team, stakeholders, and customers and leverage an increasingly wider strategic view of our organization, industry, and society. Evolutionary leaders are inspiring leaders who are able to assess, guide, and shape organizations with grace and ease.</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">Evolving isn’t a one-time process. The Unnatural Selection framework is a process that leaders leverage over the duration of their career. It’s specific enough to assist in certain digital leadership challenges and yet broad enough to remain relevant over time. I have no doubt that the framework itself will evolve. It is designed and built for the challenges we face today and in the predicted (short-term) future. Through our community of Unnatural Leaders, we will change the framework as needed, using the feedback and new awareness generated over time. This is a meta-application of the framework on itself.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">Just like paddling back out into the swell takes effort, so does evolving ourselves and our cognitive capacities. You have to do the work. You have to want to do the work. I can lead you to water, but you must take a drink yourself.</p><p id="Par10" class="Para">So how do we “do” Unnatural Selection? How do we evolve faster than the pace of change? It all starts with the evolution helix—the heart of the Unnatural Selection framework.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">The Evolution <span id="ITerm2">Helix</span></h2><p id="Par11" class="Para">The evolution helix is a process for developing our awareness with focus, effort, vulnerability, honesty, and self-compassion. It consists of four steps that we progress through in the following order: Awareness, Intention, Attention, and Reflection (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">6-1</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig1"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="height:24.55em" id="MO1" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-1. </span><span class="SimplePara">The four steps of the evolution helix</span></h6></div><p id="Par12" class="Para">Each <span id="ITerm3">cycle</span> of the evolution helix is designed to develop and evolve us. This evolution will often be small and incremental; however, there will be times when we get a significant shift in our development in one cycle of the helix. We can consider the four steps of the process (Awareness, Intention, Attention, and Reflection) as a circular process where the reflection at the end of one loop brings new awareness at the beginning the next cycle. However, when we include the vertical development of our expanding awareness, the process takes on a helix shape as we evolve (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">6-2</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:41.02em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The evolution helix</span></h6></div><p id="Par13" class="Para">Let’s take a look at an iteration of the process and get a basic understanding of each step, starting with Step 1, Awareness.</p></div><div id="Sec2" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 1: Awareness</h2><p id="Par14" class="Para">We start the process with a particular level of <span id="ITerm4">awareness</span>. This awareness is the one that you have right here, right now. It is the awareness that motivated you to read this book and to understand how you might develop your digital leadership skills. We may also be aware of the emotions and energies in our bodies as we go through our day, and how they impact our responses and performance.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par15" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“Awareness: Knowledge that something exists, or understanding of a situation or subject at the present time based on information or experience.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par16" class="Para">—Cambridge Dictionary</p></blockquote><p id="Par17" class="Para">We always have awareness. However, when we get busy, stressed, or caught up in life, we can sometimes regress to lower levels of awareness, where we become more reactionary in our actions rather than thoughtfully responding and showing up the way we desire.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">For technologists and digital leaders, a common scenario in which this happens is when a particular team member or stakeholder is “just being difficult.” We can lose our patience and react with a need to “show him who’s right”. We do this in a variety of ways, including being overly aggressive, sarcastic, or intellectually beating them down. All too often we get stuck in behaviors that don’t serve us well. Maybe we get to win this particular argument, but what happens to the long-term relationship? How does that relationship impact our success? Does the outcome of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">winning</em> this interaction really align with our path to greatness? Maybe or maybe not. Either way, it’s hasn’t been our choice, has it? Part of awareness is becoming aware of our emotional states and the judgments we are making (of ourselves and others) and then being aware of when we are reacting and not responding consciously.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">An increased awareness of what motivates people, how they process information, and how they create their internal mental models of reality is incredibly valuable for leadership success and indeed, in life. It is the primary component of deeply understanding people, which I identified earlier in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_5_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">5</span></a></span> and present again in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">6-3</a></span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:28.6em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">The three components of digital leadership success</span></h6></div><p id="Par20" class="Para">In Part II, we explore awareness in detail and introduce the Humans as a Full Stack model (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">6-4</a></span>). The Humans as a Full Stack model increases our awareness of the human levels of development, personality types, and behavior patterns and preferences. This knowledge increases our awareness.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:8.33em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">Awareness and the Humans as a Full Stack model</span></h6></div><p id="Par21" class="Para">Another valuable increase in our awareness comes from gaining clarity on what personal success means to us. Some people are already crystal clear on what success means. However, the majority of us are a little fuzzy and would benefit from investing time defining our personal success and being conscious about what we want in our lives, personally and professionally. We begin this process in Step 2, Intention.</p></div><div id="Sec3" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 2: Intention</h2><p id="Par22" class="Para">Getting clear on what success means is vital to being successful! Gaining clarity on what we want (and focusing on it) increases our ability to do what’s needed to actually achieve it. Intention focuses our attention and our energy, enabling us to respond appropriately to our environment.</p><p id="Par23" class="Para">Our neurology is bombarded with over 2 million bits of information per second: sights, sounds, smells, temperature, and pressure—most of which is filtered out, allowing us to function without being overloaded. Until you read this sentence, you probably aren’t aware of the clothes on your back and the texture and weight of the material (I’m assuming you aren’t reading this naked). Our subconscious filters out the details in our daily lives that we don’t need.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">Another commonly experienced example of this filtering in action happens when we start the process of buying a new car. Have you noticed that, as you finalize your selection down to a specific make and model of car, you begin to see more of this same model on the roads? They were always there, but with our intention to buy one, our subconscious brain put focus on a particular model and now brings them into our awareness.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">Our brains filtered out the cars and the clothing on our back because they didn’t deem the information useful or relevant at that time. Sometimes our brains filter out information that may indeed be vital to our success. With intention, we adjust these filters to let valuable and related information into our consciousness.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">Surprisingly, many people don’t actually know what they want, or what success is—success in terms of their role and/or career, for their family, and for themselves. Although success does evolve over time to mean different things, being clear on your current definition of success will bring more of it into your world. In Part III, we use the Unnatural Selection Clarity process (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">6-5</a></span>) to help develop and set intentions that are appropriate for us and our definition of success.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="height:5.95em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-5. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm5">Clarity process</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par27" class="Para">With new clarity on our individual success, Unnatural Selection recommends three intentions that drive our evolution and digital leadership success. These intentions are focused around the three critical components of success for a digital leader: Personal Success, Team Success, and Stakeholder Success.</p><p id="Par28" class="Para">Successful leaders balance their focus and attention on developing themselves, their teams, and their stakeholder relationships. A leader must constantly evolve if she is going to create and ride the waves of change. A leader is not a leader if she isn’t growing the individuals and teams that follow her by focusing on team success. And finally, successful leaders know that stakeholder relationships are how things actually get done in organizations, and as such, they prioritize stakeholder success. The three intentions that we set for personal, team, and stakeholder success are to be passionately curious, move from performance management to growth, and build long lasting, mutually beneficial relationships (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">6-6</a></span>). Let’s take a quick look at what each of these three intentions means.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:15.88em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">The three Unnatural Selection intentions</span></h6></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm6">Personal</span> Intention: Be Passionately Curious</h3><p id="Par29" class="Para">Curiosity allows us to search for new insights or perspectives and then generate new solutions (creating new waves of change). It also allows us to develop the skills we need to identify new waves of change that others have created. Without curiosity, we stagnate and operate from our historic experiences. When we become passionately curious, we enjoy the process of discovery and learning, which helps us evolve.</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm7">Team</span> Intention: Move from Performance Management to Growth</h3><p id="Par30" class="Para">Digital leaders often struggle with developing high-performance teams and long-term capability. A big part of that struggle is the lack of investment in the personal growth of the people in their teams. This struggle often manifests itself as a resistance to dealing with underperforming team members. In reality, the under performance is that of the digital leader who has not supported, challenged, or given fast and regular feedback. Our intention here is to flip this situation around and sustainably focus on the growth of our people, starting when they join the organization.</p></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm8">Stakeholder</span> Intention: Build Long-Lasting, Mutually Beneficial Relationships</h3><p id="Par31" class="Para">Long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships allow digital leaders to execute faster and more effectively across their organizations. Relationships, not process, are how things get done. Mutually beneficial relationships align outcomes across departments and functions and focus on the long-term sustainable growth of the organization.</p><p id="Par32" class="Para">Our intentions focus our attention on what is important—our self, our teams, and our stakeholders. Our attention guides our energy and determines what we do (and don’t do) as a digital leader—it’s how we execute.</p></div></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 3: Attention</h2><p id="Par33" class="Para">Attention (described in detail in Part IV) is what we “attend to”—it’s how we do digital leadership. Our leadership attention is spent completing tasks, having conversations, delivering presentations, and attending meetings. We might even invest in some form of training or learning (books like this included), which directly impact our awareness and/or skillset.</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">Without first setting a higher intention, we can fall into the trap of carrying out these actions simply to get them done and tick the completed box. The difference between doing “leadership” and being an Unnatural Leader is that Unnatural Leaders hold a higher intention and don’t complete activities for the sake of completing them.
</p><blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p id="Par35" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                  <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">“If you don't pay appropriate attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention than it deserves.”</em>
                </p><p id="Par36" class="Para">—David Allen<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote><p id="Par38" class="Para">The attention of Unnatural Leaders is focused by the trinity of intentions we set on self, team, and stakeholders. We use the three attention processes (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">6-7</a></span>) that assist us in executing each of these intentions in a concrete manner.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig7"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig7_HTML.jpg" style="height:7.05em" id="MO7" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-7. </span><span class="SimplePara">The three attention processes</span></h6></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Attention to <span id="ITerm9">Self</span></h3><p id="Par39" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders are proactive, not reactive. They take ownership of their time and attention and they use intention to devise systems that keep them working on the right things in the best ways to achieve success. These systems help them overcome the key challenges of choosing what to work on, help them hold the right frames and perspectives on the task at hand, and help them focus on execution and delivery results.</p></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Attention to <span id="ITerm10">Team</span></h3><p id="Par40" class="Para">We focus our attention on our people and teams because we value their growth and development. We attend to their development by understanding each individual’s Human Full Stack. We coach and support them to their maximum potential. It is critical that our teams evolve faster than the pace of change if we want our organization to create and respond to disruption.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Attention to Stakeholders</h3><p id="Par41" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm11">Stakeholder</span> Attention process guides us through building long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships. We start by ensuring that we have identified the relevant stakeholders and then develop our understanding of what is important to them. We then align (where possible) to their outcomes and use a range of techniques to positively influence them.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para">As we execute our Unnatural Leadership, we are likely to perform highly at some activities and less so at others. In order to appraise our performance, we need to reflect on what we do, why we do it, and how it drives us toward or away from success. We do this in Step 4: Reflection.</p></div></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Step 4: Reflection</h2><p id="Par43" class="Para"><span id="ITerm12">Reflection</span> is the process of taking time to sit and think deeply about our past experiences and what the future may hold. We look at our past to assess how well our outcomes aligned with our intentions, and how we might adapt in order to improve our performance and experiences in the future.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">Pausing to reflect can feel unproductive to busy leaders. Because of this, so many leaders don’t make the time to regularly stop and reflect, unless they are forced to by a significant, painful failure. However, reflection is the key to accelerating our evolution and evolving faster than the pace of change.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders use a variety of methods to assist in reflection (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig8">6-8</a></span>). This includes journaling, feedback, coaching, mentoring, and levels of perspective (see Chapters <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_17_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">17</span></a></span> and <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_18_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">18</span></a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig8"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig8_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig8_HTML.jpg" style="height:9.33em" id="MO8" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-8. </span><span class="SimplePara">Past and future <span id="ITerm13">reflection methods</span></span></h6></div><p id="Par46" class="Para">Reflecting by ourselves is powerful and valuable. Reflecting with external assistance from a coach or mentor can accelerate our evolution by showing us blind spots that could otherwise have taken us months or years to see on our own.</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">Reflection powers our evolution, and personal evolution is a process of growth. It’s practically impossible to grow when we hold a fixed mindset about who we are.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">A Growth Mindset</h2><p id="Par48" class="Para">The concept of a <span id="ITerm14">growth mindset</span> has been popularized by Carol Dweck, a Stanford psychologist, in her book <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.</em><a href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source"><sup>3</sup></a> At the core of a growth mindset (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig9">6-9</a></span>) is a belief that we, as human beings, evolve over time, and we are constantly growing, learning, and developing our capacities. In contrast, a fixed mindset leaves us limited by the belief that our personalities, intelligence, and who we take ourselves to be are fundamentally set in stone.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig9"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig9_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_6_Fig9_HTML.jpg" style="height:46.98em" id="MO9" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 6-9. </span><span class="SimplePara">Carol Dweck’s fixed versus growth mindsets (image courtesy Nigel Holmes) <span id="ITerm15">

You aren’t the same person you were a decade ago, last year, or even just yesterday!</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">If we don’t grow and evolve, our environment—our business verticals—will grow and evolve past us. I’m sure the leaders of Blockbuster video held limiting beliefs about themselves and their business as the market got disrupted and evolved faster than they did. Change is uncomfortable until we do it again and again, and then change becomes our new normal.
