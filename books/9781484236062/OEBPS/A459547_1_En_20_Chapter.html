It’s my vision that together we form a community of like-minded digital leaders who create the best possible future for our fellow humans, future generations, and our planet.</p><p id="Par6" class="Para">I believe that together we can create better experiences for digital leaders (us) that are less stressful, more empowering, achieve higher success, and have a more significant impact on the world. Because Unnatural Leaders value their teams, we will create the same improvements for them too. At a basic level, an organization is a collection of people organized in a particular manner. Therefore, if we can impact the people in the teams, we can impact organizations. With better organizations, we can positively impact society and the human race.</p><div id="Sec1" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">

What better way to connect with and assist others than to talk from personal experience, model new behaviors, and share our evolution.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">So what do you need to do to ignite yourself right now?

Before you run off to change the world, I’d like to leave you with a few questions to ignite your thinking. These questions are focused on potential future scenarios and take the form of “What If?”. I hope they challenge you (in a supportive way) to think about the future and ignite you to shape it positively.</p><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What If Artificial <span id="ITerm5">Intelligence</span><span id="ITerm6">
                
                
              </span> Takes Over?</h3><p id="Par29" class="Para">In my opinion, this isn’t really a what-if scenario, it’s a when, and a “then what?” question.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">Artificial intelligence is going to change the world in the most significant way we have ever seen; it will be a transformative shift for the human race, much like the end of the dinosaurs.</p><p id="Par31" class="Para">If we look far enough into the future, robots will become ubiquitous and automate almost everything we do. The majority of jobs performed by humans will disappear. At a sufficient intelligence and capability level, I can’t currently see any job that would survive. I’m not even sure that I can comprehend the incredible levels of intelligence that AI could reach and what it will mean for us.</p><p id="Par32" class="Para">Think about it for a moment… Take the most intelligent person who has ever walked our planet and increase their intelligence by an order of magnitude. Now put that intelligence into a robot! Its capability would be immense. Every single thing we humans could think of, “it” would have thought about already and with a greater ability.</p><p id="Par33" class="Para">It’s possible that this incredible capacity might solve the meaning of life or how the universe was created. Maybe robots will destroy us and the universe—if indeed it can be destroyed. (If you’ve ever studied physics, energy at a universal level is never destroyed, it is merely converted.)</p><p id="Par34" class="Para">Maybe they will discover dimensions of reality that we don’t know exist. Much like the story of the fictional, 2D man who exists and perceives reality in only two dimensions. When he views an object, all he is able to perceive is its width, height, and boundaries. When presented with a 3D cube, he has no ability to perceive its third dimension. So, as the cube moves closer to him (through the third dimension), he perceives a 2D shape increasing in size. As the cube moves away, he perceives it as getting smaller. All he perceives are the X and Y dimensions and therefore the shape and size of objects. He has no awareness or concept of the third dimension.</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">What if humans are just like the 2D man, only we can see one more dimension? Will these new hyper-intelligent robots be able to perceive other dimensions and, if so, how many more might there be?</p><p id="Par36" class="Para">These advances in “intelligence” cause me to wonder what it is to be human and what consciousness is. At the later stages of human development, a non-dual, unity awareness is achieved (often called enlightenment). With it comes the realization that all of reality is constructed, not just our beliefs and assumptions, but our physical bodies too. The illusion that we are merely an individual human mind and body falls away as we become aware of our full connection to the universe, the source, or the “divine”. What does that mean for robots—they came from the same matter we did—we are all made of the same atoms, molecules, and elements that came from the universe? If robots become “conscious,” are they our equals? How should we recognize robots both legally and ethically?</p><p id="Par37" class="Para">In the not-so-distant future, a majority of jobs that humans perform will disappear as robots take over and complete them more efficiently, more safely, and more reliably. I predict that the same powerful humans who control the wheels of commerce, industry, and political systems today, will continue to get richer and more powerful as they expand their control over the organizations that build the robots that run our world.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">What I’m unsure of is, what will happen to everyone else? Will we all become part of a poor, underground race that eats rat burgers to survive (as in the 1993 movie <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Demolition Man</em>), or will we all live a utopian life of bliss as robots perform our tasks and chores for us? If we do move to this seemingly utopian existence, what will we do? Will we search for purpose or merely enjoy the pleasures of life? How will we pay for these pleasures? Aside from robotics, will pleasure providers be the only businesses left?</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">I’m sure that virtual reality will play a big part in how we experience pleasure. Consider, if you will, the advancements made in technology over the last 40-50 years. Computers have evolved from blocky, green screen displays with kilobytes of memory to 8K ultra-high definition, real-time, photorealistic rendering, multi-channel spatial audio and force feedback systems.</p><p id="Par40" class="Para">Now factor in the exponential rate of change and what VR will be capable of in the next 40 years. I believe that future VR systems will generate these new experiences through a direct connection to our nervous system (a neuralink). This connection will trigger all of our senses electrically, allowing us not only to see and hear new realities in ultra-high definition, but also taste, feel, and smell them! At some point, the “virtual realities” that we have will become indistinguishable from actual reality!</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">This situation then poses another question: If virtual realities can be created that are indistinguishable from actual reality, did someone or something already beat us to it? Are we the ones living in the matrix? Maybe the robots (or an alien race) conquered the planet centuries ago and everything we experience, including ourselves, is not real? If this were true, it would mean that TEA model that describes how our thoughts, emotions, and actions inter-operate could merely be a function in a much larger, complex artificial universe.</p></div><div id="Sec7" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What If We Prepare Our Children for the Digital Future?</h3><p id="Par42" class="Para">We’ve spent this book looking at how <span id="ITerm7">digital leaders</span> can deal with disruption today and how we prepare for the future, but what about our children? How do we prepare them for a future where jobs might be extremely limited? What skills and capacities should we teach our children to give them the best chance of a good life?</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">Some think that the creative side of humans will survive the artificial intelligence wave. They believe that art, music, and innovative thinking are what we need to focus on. I think that is a reasonable answer, but only for a short period of time. Creativity (with enough knowledge and intelligence) can be modeled. After all, most creative, innovative pursuits are not divine acts of inspiration. They are products of an individual’s experiences, skills, knowledge, and, more often than not, their ability to connect different ideas and concepts in a new “creative” way. Therefore, with enough intelligence and knowledge, robots will at some point be “creative”. Even now, in this present day, you probably can’t tell can’t tell the difference between Bach and music written by AI in his style.<a href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p id="Par45" class="Para">So how do we prepare our children for the future? For me, the gifts I plan to give my children are the skills and knowledge to live a self-sufficient life and the ability to deeply understand themselves (and who they are) in order to live a satisfying life.</p><p id="Par46" class="Para">To be able to live self-sufficiently, I have already started to give my children the skills to live off the grid by harnessing renewable energy and performing basic construction. I plan to teach them how to farm their own organic food and source clean water. These skills will enable them to survive in a future where there may be no jobs for them or the safest places are far from city blocks.</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">The required investment in time and energy to develop these skills is minimal. So if the future is utopian, very little is lost and we have all had the enjoyment of creating and learning together. And, they will have learned what it takes to live self-sufficiently.</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">These skills must be accompanied by developing a mindset and awareness that brings them contentment and satisfaction from their experiences.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">Understanding ourselves is the journey of life. Universally, the journey of life begins with programming and beliefs that cause us considerable challenges as we age. It may be that the purpose of life is to overcome these challenges. I don’t know. What I do know is that we need to change the basic way we program our children. We need to remove the judgments of “good” and “bad” from our language. We need to become conscious of the limiting beliefs that we pass on, either explicitly with comments like “You’re not a very musical child” or “It’s okay, why don’t you try sport instead” or implicitly, by not modeling positive behaviors such as healthy eating and exercise. The evolution of the human race is fueled by the evolution of parenting and education. As we evolve as adults and parents, we need to evolve our parenting and the systems of education.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">I’d like to see high schools consistently teaching basic psychology, including self-awareness, resilience, non-judgment, and emotional regulation.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">What If We Genuinely Believed Every Challenge (or Failure) We Faced Was a Gift?</h3><p id="Par51" class="Para">My understanding of what it means to be “enlightened” is to realize that reality as we perceive it is a construct in our minds and is not true reality. I believe that it is possible that we are given <span id="ITerm8">challenges and failures</span> to experience for a reason—to show us where we need to focus our attention in order to grow. For example, when we experience frustration, it’s usually because the world isn’t how we want or expect it to be. We become frustrated because people aren’t behaving how we want them to or because we don’t feel or look the way we want to, or even because we didn’t get that promotion we know we deserve. We resist actual reality because it doesn’t conform to the reality we constructed in our minds. Put simply, most of our struggles in life occur when our expectations are not met.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">Our development is to understand these challenges and learn not to resist and judge reality in a way that creates pain for ourselves. Being enlightened is the appreciation and acceptance of what actual reality presents to us, without resistance to it.</p><p id="Par53" class="Para">There are times when I directly experience this state of acceptance and appreciation, and then there are times when I resist reality and have a negative response to how others behave.</p><p id="Par54" class="Para">Writing a book can be a challenging experience for first-time authors. It’s uncomfortable, amazing, enjoyable, disheartening, and insightful—and sometimes all those things at once. I realized early on as I struggled through the self-doubt, self-judgment, and fear of failure that writing a book (for me at least) isn’t actually about the act of creating a book. It is a deep journey of personal development. I’m not sure any new author could publish a book without having to face at least one personal challenge (e.g., perfectionism, judgment, or a belief that you just aren’t good enough or don’t know enough) and conquer it. Writing a book has been one of the biggest opportunities for growth that I have been given and I genuinely appreciate it.</p><p id="Par55" class="Para">Another such “gift” was that of my (extremely messy) divorce, which lasted over three years and involved my 8-year-old son. For a few dark weeks, I lost my way and, to be honest, I almost didn’t find my way back. Diagnosed with deep clinical depression, my doctor prescribed antidepressants. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t take them; it just didn’t feel right. I wanted out of the dark days but something inside me would not allow me to take the medication, so I struggled on.</p><p id="Par56" class="Para">My divorce and my depression led me to the coaching world of NLP—neuro-semantics, integral theory, and the Enneagram—to find a way out of the darkness. Learning how humans construct perspectives on reality, how we create beliefs, and how personalities are constructed changed my life; the coaches changed my life; I changed my life.</p><p id="Par57" class="Para">This book wouldn’t be in your hands today if it weren’t for my divorce. Don’t get me wrong, it was not a pleasant experience at all. And for years after I hated and resented it. But now, after considerable reflection, I accept and appreciate the gift it gave me.</p><p id="Par58" class="Para">So if you are struggling right now, I offer you this: in your darkest moments, know that it’s going to be okay. Know that the experience will pass and that there is support out there even if you can’t see it or believe it.
