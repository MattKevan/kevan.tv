                </span></h3><p id="Par7" class="Para">Albert Einstein famously said, “I have no special talents; I am only passionately curious.”</p><p id="Par8" class="Para">We all know that passionate curiosity wasn’t the only thing that allowed Einstein to make the discoveries and scientific contributions to science that he did—he was incredibly intelligent too! What Einstein is alluding to with this quote, is that the fact that humans can do great things when they are both passionate and curious about a subject.</p><p id="Par9" class="Para">Being passionately curious creates a sustained energy and interest in things we are focusing on (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">13-2</a></span>). The passion drives our sustained focus, while curiosity opens our minds and perspectives to ask questions and dive into areas that we may have otherwise missed or dismissed.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig2"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="height:21.08em" id="MO2" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-2. </span><span class="SimplePara">The intention: to be passionately curious</span></h6></div><p id="Par10" class="Para">Unnatural Leaders have a passionate curiosity for the world around them and for the development of themselves and others. They are excited by the potential of their own growth, the opportunities that it might bring, the impact that they will have, and the legacy that they will leave. They are curious about how and why they operate the way they do and how this affects their performance and the performance of those around them. The original passion they had for technology and problem solving is now focused on the process of self-evolution and actualizing their full potential (which includes the development of others).</p><p id="Par11" class="Para">Let’s go back to our wave surfing metaphor but this time from a perspective that has little to no passion or curiosity:</p><p id="Par12" class="Para">Our leader is standing on the beach, looking out at the ocean preparing to surf the waves of change. As she stands there she is filled with fear and anxiety about how well she will perform. She stands on the beach, for what seems like an eternity, looking for a wave that looks perfect but just never comes. The longer she waits, the less she wants to go. The less she wants to go out there, the more mentally painful the whole experience becomes. As her stress builds, her muscles and posture tighten and her breathing rate increases. She is now in fight or flight mode. When she does eventually hit the surf, she tries a small wave and her rigid body causes her to crash out instantly. She heads back to the beach where she mentally confirms the idea that she can't surf. Surfing is not for her; she isn’t good enough. She just doesn’t have the physical build or coordination to do it.</p><p id="Par13" class="Para">She gives up.</p><p id="Par14" class="Para">With passionate curiosity, the same leader looks out over the ocean with excitement (and a maybe a little fear). She is curious about the waves that are rolling in and where the rips are. She chats with a local surfer and confesses her inexperience. The surfer gives her some great tips on where and how to enter the ocean and which waves to try first. She enters the ocean knowing she’s going to fall. It’s inevitable but she is curious about how and why. She’s curious about what it feels like to ride even a small wave and she understands that becoming a great surfer is a process that takes many repetitions.</p><p id="Par15" class="Para">She enters the ocean and laughs as she gets knocked around. She catches a little wave for a few seconds and topples ungracefully into the water. She quickly processes the experience and tries again, and again, and again. Sometimes she rides a lot further, other times she falls instantly. But all the time her curiosity keeps her eyes scanning the ocean for waves, watching the other surfers ride gracefully, she adapts something in her style with each wave she rides.</p><p id="Par16" class="Para">She ends the day, tired, cold, and still curious! She’s still not a confident surfer, but she can surf better than she could two hours earlier. As one of the pro-surfers comes into the beach, she asks him more questions and manages to get a couple of great tips to try next time.</p><p id="Par17" class="Para">Two years later, she’s the surfer out at the back catching the big waves (almost) every time.</p><p id="Par18" class="Para">The difference between the two scenarios is dramatic. One leader lasted five minutes and gave up focusing on improving her leadership ability and likely continued to get slammed by each new wave of disruption. The second Unnatural Leader became a great surfer, creating new waves of change that were bigger and bigger each year—all with an intention of being passionately curious and holding a growth mindset.</p><p id="Par19" class="Para">Being passionately curious allows us to seek help from others, and allows us to ask questions of ourselves that improve our performance. It acknowledges that it’s okay to not have the answers or be competent at everything. Curiosity helps us achieve what’s important to us by enabling our growth and evolution.

                </span><span id="ITerm8">
                  
                  
                  
                </span>. Managing the performance of the people who directly report to us can be a challenge. Performance management all too often means we have identified low performance in someone and we need to intervene and restructure or terminate that person’s employment. Now, as anyone with any leadership experience will know, unless gross misconduct is involved, we can’t just fire someone—we have to “performance manage” them.</p><p id="Par24" class="Para">Gross misconduct aside, there are times when a person should not be in an organization, either because they are behaving in a toxic and disruptive manner or because they have little to no interest in the organization’s products and vision. Either way, they have already mentally left the organization and there is no obvious way to bring them back effectively. However, these people and the ones who perform gross misconduct are a very small minority.</p><p id="Par25" class="Para">The <span id="ITerm9">majority of</span> performance management scenarios involve the leader either poorly clarifying expectations and/or not giving the appropriate feedback early enough. By the time the employee's performance becomes an issue, it has usually become so severe that the conversation becomes difficult for the leader to have, and for the employee to receive. Worse still, in some situations the leader uses the performance management process to work toward firing an individual, having already predetermined their fate.</p><p id="Par26" class="Para">The irony is that the leaders who do this are actually under-performing at performance management. It is our job as leaders to be clear about expectations, to reiterate those expectations early and often, and provide feedback when it looks like the employee is failing to meet those expectations. It is almost always down to us, as leaders, if the conversation has reached a difficult stage.</p><p id="Par27" class="Para">So how can we fix this? To start, we need to flip this process on its head and focus on the <span id="ITerm10">growth of</span> our people first (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">13-3</a></span>). This means caring for, growing, and supporting every team member from the day they join our organization. It involves understanding their goals and motivators, setting them exciting and challenging development plans, supporting them with timely and constructive feedback, and providing coaching and training when required.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig3"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig3_HTML.jpg" style="height:24.42em" id="MO3" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-3. </span><span class="SimplePara">Intention: move from performance management to growth</span></h6></div><p id="Par28" class="Para">Leaders who genuinely care for a person's development and put the time and effort into growing their people are the leaders who succeed. They succeed both professionally and personally. As humans, we are wired for connecting with others to give and receive love and support. Immense (intrinsic) satisfaction comes from the positive relationships we have with people and this is amplified further when we nurture them and help them to grow.</p><p id="Par29" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">It expands beyond just redefining our personal success to be that of our team’s commercial or productive success. It’s about the people in our teams rising to challenges, overcoming them, and doing something great together. Great leaders provide direction, challenge, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">and</em> support: support to grow, to master, to evolve.</p><p id="Par30" class="Para">For Unnatural Leaders, professional success comes, in part, from building a sustained high-performance capability (where a significant part centers around attracting and retaining the best talent). The best people work for the best leaders in the best organizations. The best organizations become the best because they have leaders that genuinely care for and grow their people. Period!</p><p id="Par31" class="Para">The war for talent will intensify greatly (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">13-4</a></span>) as we move to a more advanced digital society and the demand for digital talent peaks. This peak demand is likely to be the last we will see at this level due to the ever-increasing capability of AI and robotics taking over even the most advanced digital development functions when AI learns to code.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig4"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig4_HTML.jpg" style="height:20.42em" id="MO4" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-4. </span><span class="SimplePara">The <span id="ITerm11">intensifying talent war</span></span></h6></div><div id="Sec4" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Caring for People Doesn’t Mean We Are Doormats!</h4><p id="Par32" class="Para"><span id="ITerm12">Growing and caring</span> for people does not mean we roll over and meet their demands, putting their needs before our own, or becoming a “doormat” for people to walk over on a daily basis. It’s not about being a counselor or friend either. It is about challenging people to be the best they can; pushing them out of their comfort zones to try new and different things; to support and hold a space for them when they fail, because they will (and should because that’s how they will learn!).</p><p id="Par33" class="Para">So, if you’re going to do this, you need to be ready to let some of your people fail so they can grow. Are you okay with that? Are you okay with failure for them, and potentially for your team and your own outcomes?</p></div><div id="Sec5" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">We Can’t Fake It Well!</h4><p id="Par34" class="Para">I’ve said it before, but I’ll say it again: Tech people are smart, very smart. However, no leader, including tech leaders, can sustainably fake genuine care for their teams. At some point, (probably sooner than you would like), your teams will know by your verbal or nonverbal <span id="ITerm13">communications</span> that your care for their growth and development isn’t genuine.</p><p id="Par35" class="Para">If you have any resistance to the concept of caring for people and focusing on their growth, can you give yourself permission to try it on for a few weeks? An easy place to start (if you aren’t doing this already) is to get to know your people with real one-on-ones. I don’t mean conversations where you communicate the latest strategy, changes, and priorities and then get a progress update from them—that’s not a real one-on-one. I mean can you have a one-on-one and talk about none of that? Can you ask how they are, where they would like to go in their career, how their family is, and sit and listen? (Stop talking and listen; really listen!) Listening is a good discipline to practice at every level of leadership.</p></div></div><div id="Sec6" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading">Intention 3: <span id="ITerm14">Build Long Lasting</span>, <span id="ITerm15">Mutually Beneficial Relationships</span></h3><p id="Par36" class="Para">Imagine a world where we had great relationships with all our stakeholders. Wouldn’t that be awesome? As digital leaders, we have to engage and balance a wide variety of stakeholders from technical product teams, non-technical product functions, marketing departments, finance departments, and the senior executives of the organization. All too often we engage with stakeholders when we have to, in order to (hopefully) get what we need to enable us to deliver. This tactic is sub-optimal at best, giving us results with only those that we naturally connect with or that coincidentally have similar objectives. Instead, Unnatural Leaders address this by setting the intention to build long-lasting, <span id="ITerm16">mutually beneficial relationships</span> (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig5">13-5</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig5"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig5_HTML.jpg" style="height:19.62em" id="MO5" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-5. </span><span class="SimplePara"><span id="ITerm17">Build long lasting</span>, mutually beneficial relationships</span></h6></div><p id="Par37" class="Para">A mutually beneficial relationship is a relationship where both parties benefit from collaborating on the same outcome (such as delivering a project or cross-organizational initiative) or, over the duration of the relationship, both parties achieve their own individual outcomes that would have been difficult or impossible to achieve otherwise. In the latter case, person A might assist person B’s activity with no immediate return on that investment. Both parties acknowledge the value of collaboration, and working toward higher priority, organizational objectives together and that when their initiative is a priority, others will assist them.</p><p id="Par38" class="Para">Over time, the <span id="ITerm18">interactions</span> between two parties build trust. Each party develops their understanding of the other as commitments are made and delivered against. Even when commitments cannot be met—the relationship allows for honest and transparent communication early enough for appropriate action to be taken. This forms a foundation of trust, and a pattern for how to work together.</p><p id="Par39" class="Para">“Mutually beneficial” usually involves some give and take. Sometimes the other party assists us with our initiatives, other times we assist them with theirs. The ultimate outcome however is to drive alignment in both initiatives and find a common ground to build from. Every initiative in an organization should be connected to a goal, strategy, or mission to which both parties can align. If there is indeed no common ground, it’s likely that one of the initiatives should not be progressed.</p><div id="Sec7" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">We Like People Like Us</h4><p id="Par40" class="Para">One of the biggest <span id="ITerm19">challenges</span> to creating <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">all</em> the relationships required for success is that we tend to avoid the people we don’t like. We might avoid them completely or push through our initiatives hoping for the best or even try to railroad the other person into submission. When we don’t like someone it clouds our ability to create professional and productive relationships that are required for ultimate success.</p><p id="Par41" class="Para">Have you noticed that the people you dislike seem to do everything wrong? They do things differently to the way we prefer; they don’t understand where we are coming from and they communicate in a confusing or frustrating manner. On the other hand, the people you like seem to do most things right, and if they don’t, we understand why and give them the benefit of the doubt.</p><p id="Par42" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">Have you ever stopped and thought about the meaning of the word “like”? In everyday parlance, we use it to positively describe something we prefer and are happy to engage more in, be that food, music, sports, etc. When it comes to people, our use of like implies a positive relationship that we are happy to engage in. Another use for the word “like” is to identify similarities in two or more things. That car is just like my car, that dog is like the one next door, etc. What’s interesting is that generally when we refer to liking someone (preference), we actually mean we are like them and they are like us—two parties that have similar worldviews, values, interests, goals, and ways of communicating. We like them and we <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">are</em> like them.</p><p id="Par43" class="Para">At the early stages of leadership, our focus tends to be on getting things done: delivering a product or project within a shorter-term focus. This, combined with our natural tendency toward detail and technology, can often see us avoiding stakeholders and only engaging with them when we have to. Often we engage with them when they get in the way, or when we need something from them. Our communications usually revolve around what we want or need, and potentially, why they “need” to help us. Equally, our conversations can be laden with technical jargon that alienates non-technical stakeholders.</p><p id="Par44" class="Para">As we grow, we become more aware of the relationship impact of “how things get done around here”. We focus more on stakeholders and start to maintain relationships that transcend delivery projects. We still have a strong delivery and outcome focus, but appreciate the value of maintaining relationships more.</p><p id="Par45" class="Para">In later stages of development, we find a balance between delivery (action focused on outcomes) and the appropriate engagement of stakeholders. Not only do we actively engage stakeholders, we co-create solutions and delivery in partnership with them. We maintain the relationships over the long-term, giving and taking for the greater benefit of the organization.</p></div><div id="Sec8" class="Section3 RenderAsSection3"><h4 class="Heading">Frames of Mind</h4><p id="Par46" class="Para"><span id="ITerm20">Frames of mind</span> are critical to stakeholder engagement and relationship building. If we conceptualize a stakeholder relationship as a battle, each interaction is either won or lost and usually at some cost. It’s a negative and stressful way to exist. Even when we think we’re winning the battle, we can often end up losing the war!</p><p id="Par47" class="Para">“Politics” or game playing is another negative frame commonly used by digital leaders. Politics usually involve hidden agendas, power plays, and abrasive or subversive behaviors. While we may encounter this with some stakeholders, and often can’t be avoided, it’s not an empowering frame to use for stakeholder engagement on the whole.</p><p id="Par48" class="Para">I’ve coached a number of senior leaders who have held negative frames about stakeholder engagement. In one scenario, the leader was having difficulty gaining traction and buy-in to drive the required changes in her organization. In our coaching conversations, it became apparent that she refused to engage with certain stakeholders, preferring to focus on more productive tasks. When I asked why this was, she told me that she didn’t play politics and anyone she considered “political” she avoided.</p><p id="Par49" class="Para">Her lack of engagement with the required stakeholders meant her initiatives were getting stuck and facing resistance (sometimes silently). If she was to stand any chance of success, she had to either engage with her stakeholders or continue her struggle to gain traction. To enable her to do not just engage but build healthy relationships with her stakeholders, we reframed her actions of engaging them from “playing politics” to that of a game of chess. Like most digital leaders, she loved solving problems, and she also loved the strategy required to play and win chess. When she reframed stakeholder engagement as a game of chess, it became an enjoyable problem to be solved and a game to be played. From that point on, she actively engaged her stakeholders and had a significant impact on the organization.</p><p id="Par50" class="Para">In summary, Unnatural Leaders set three key intentions: to be passionately curious, to move from performance management to growth, and to build long lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with their stakeholders (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">13-6</a></span>).</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig6"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig6_HTML.jpg" style="height:22.72em" id="MO6" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-6. </span><span class="SimplePara">The three intentions</span></h6></div></div></div></div><div id="Sec9" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span id="ITerm21">Define</span> Your Own Intentions</h2><p id="Par51" class="Para">Now we have defined three intentions that bring to life the things that are important to Unnatural Leaders—Personal Success, Team Success, and Stakeholder Success—it is time to define any intentions you need in order to realize any other important items on the list you created in Chapter <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="A459547_1_En_12_Chapter.html"><span class="RefSource">12</span></a></span>.</p><p id="Par52" class="Para">When setting intentions for the items on your list, it can help to think about the following questions in order to develop and state a suitable intention:
</p><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet" id="List1"><li><p id="Par53" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">What principle would help me focus on what’s important?</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par54" class="Para">We can think about intentions as if they were principles. For example, Unnatural Leaders hold a principle to always be passionately curious. These types of intentions are useful when we have a long-term vision that impacts how we want to be.</p></li><li><p id="Par55" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild">
                    <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold">How might I flip the problem I want to fix to see it another way?</strong>
                  </p><p id="Par56" class="Para">With the team intention, we identified that performance management was a problem. When we flipped the problem and started with an intention to grow our teams and give them constant support and feedback, suddenly the task became much more inviting. Holding this intention fixes the performance management problem at its core and reframes it as an opportunity.</p></li></ul><p id="Par57" class="Para">Use these techniques to experiment with developing intentions that feel appropriate to you. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, and our intentions evolve over time. The trick (like being tactical and strategic) is to balance defining intentions and evolving them without under-committing and frequently changing them.</p></div><div id="Sec10" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Setting Intentions</h2><p id="Par58" class="Para">We have now defined the intentions that we wish to use to guide our attention and energy. Step 4 of the Clarity Process (see Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7">13-7</a></span>) guides us through the process of setting these intentions. Setting an intention is about making a personal commitment with ourselves, because new intentions mean change, they mean breaking old habits and doing things differently. This takes <span id="ITerm22">energy, effort, and conscious focus</span>.</p><div class="Figure" id="Fig7"><img src="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="images/A459547_1_En_13_Fig7_HTML.jpg" style="height:6.95em" id="MO7" /><h6 class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><span class="CaptionNumber">Figure 13-7. </span><span class="SimplePara">Set, Step 4 of the Clarity Process</span></h6></div><p id="Par59" class="Para">The effort we exert to change involves thinking about people, scenarios, and problems in new ways, questioning our prior assumptions and being curious about alternatives. Our emotions and habits often pull us back into old behaviours and away from our intentions. We have to start the intentionality process with a commitment to ourselves. Can you commit yourself to be intentional? If your answer is yes, great! If not, can you give yourself permission to try being intentional for four weeks (or more)? If not, what’s stopping you? Consider what is more important than doing this work—the work of evolving yourself and becoming more successful?</p><p id="Par60" class="Para">Success, as I pointed out earlier, is an inside job. We feel success as a positive emotional state. What’s interesting is that we are able to create a positive emotional state right now by visualizing success in our minds and feeling it in our bodies. When we imagine what it would look, feel, sound, and smell like to be successful (utilizing all of our senses), we experience the positive emotional state we are hoping for in the future. When done correctly, the intensity of this (artificially created) state gets stored in our bodies as a real experience that we can utilize.</p><p id="Par61" class="Para">The power of creating success in our minds and feeling the positive emotions is the fuel for us to change. It creates positive energy in our system, which we can use to focus our attention to create the changes we desire for success.</p><p id="Par62" class="Para">Follow this six-step process to set your intentions:

You were probably excited and eager to learn more.</p></li><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par65" class="Para">Allow yourself to feel into the emotional state and the thinking that came with this passionate curiosity.

However, our world is full of distractions. So we have to consciously practice holding our intentions front of mind in our day-to-day lives and support them with processes to enable us to focus and achieve what we desire. We discuss the process of holding our intentions in Part IV: Attention.</p></div><div id="Sec11" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary</h2><p id="Par71" class="Para">Success means different things to different people and so it should. In the context of digital leadership, Unnatural Leaders set the three intentions: to be passionately curious, to move from performance management to growth of our people, and to build long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships. All of these are designed to bring about success in a professional context.</p><p id="Par72" class="Para">Over time, the intentions of Unnatural Leaders adapt to address the evolving landscape they operate in. For the foreseeable future, the three Unnatural Selection intentions are essential to successful digital leadership.</p><p id="Par73" class="Para">How we frame a situation determines the meaning we make and therefore whether we are drawn toward or away from it. Frames of mind are critical to achieving success as is being aware of the people we like and dislike. Our interactions with people change dramatically based on how much we like them, and negative frames can subconsciously impede our chance of success.</p><p id="Par74" class="Para">With a new awareness of these issues, we are better positioned to choose how we operate and what we do. We can better focus our energy and attention as set by our intentions.</p></div><div id="Sec12" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Self-Reflection Questions</h2><ol class="autonumber decimal OrderedList" id="List3"><li class="ListItem"><p id="Par76" class="Para">On average, how would you rate your level of curiosity in your role?

Is there something in Part II: Awareness that you learned about yourself that could fuel an intention?</p></li></ol></div><div id="Sec13" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading">Summary of Part III: Intention</h2><p id="Par80" class="Para">Defining intentions helps guide our energy and attention to what is important. They shape how we approach our daily activities. Without intentionality, we run the risk of getting caught up in our busy days. We run the risk of being distracted away from the things that are really important to us and sometimes, we find ourselves behaving in a manner that brings about exactly the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.</p><p id="Par81" class="Para">James Cameron used intentionality to become one the most successful Hollywood movie directors of all time. He could have become caught up in the manic demands of movie creation or produced a movie that was on a par with the movies of the day. He didn’t. He held an intention to push the boundaries of what was possible. His highest frame was to create new and innovative cinematic techniques. He starts each movie project with this intention and he executes on it.</p><p id="Par82" class="Para">Understanding what is important to us as leaders and humans is critical to our success and leading a quality life. Spending time understanding what we enjoy, love and value is time extremely well spent. All too often, leaders get pulled along with the social and professional tides, trying to keep their heads above water, and realizing too late that what they were striving for really wasn’t important to us at all.</p><p id="Par83" class="Para">What's important to us changes over the years. When we have a true growth mindset, we realize that what is important today may not be next month or next year. As we grow, our awareness grows and often what's important to us changes. It is therefore essential to use the Clarity Process and set intentions for each major iteration of the evolution helix.</p></div><div class="FootnoteSection"><h1 class="Heading">Footnotes</h1><div class="Footnote" id="Fn1"><p id="Par4" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn1_source">1</a> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Leadership Is An Art</em> (NY: Crown Business, 2004).</p></div><div class="Footnote" id="Fn2"><p id="Par22" class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild"><span class="FootnoteNumber"><a href="#Fn2_source">2</a> </span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">You Can Become the Person You Want to Be</em> (NY: Hawthorn Books, 1973)</p></div></div></div></div>
