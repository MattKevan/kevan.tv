            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we'll work on this main content area, the area where the posts show up. Right now it's just a bunch of static HTML, so we'll go ahead and fix that.</p>
<p>So let's go into the <kbd>index.php</kbd> file in the <kbd>MyShop</kbd> folder in themes. Let's go to <kbd>div class="products"</kbd> where we have 4-column divs to represent each product. We'll add a class of row on this <kbd>products</kbd> div and then get rid of all but one of these 4-column divs. We'll preserve the <kbd>div</kbd> tag with the black shirt details. We'll get rid of all the div tags and then inside the 4-column div we'll go right above it and create our <kbd>while</kbd> loop.</p>
<p><span>Before we do the <kbd>while</kbd> loop, though, let's make sure that there are some posts. So we'll say <kbd>if(have_posts)</kbd> and then we'll end it.</span> <span>Also, if there are some posts then we want our <kbd>while</kbd> loop:</span></p>
<pre class="mce-root">&lt;div class="grid-x grid-padding-x products"&gt;<br/>   &lt;?php if(have_posts()) : ?&gt;<br/>      &lt;?php while(have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt;<br/>         &lt;div class="large-4 medium-4 cell product end"&gt;<br/>            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;<br/>            &lt;?php if(has_post_thumbnail()) : ?&gt;<br/>               &lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt;<br/>            &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br/> <br/>            &lt;a class="button" href="&lt;?php echo <br/>               the_permalink(); ?&gt;"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt;<br/>         &lt;/div&gt;<br/>      &lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;<br/>   &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p><span>So we'll say <kbd>php while</kbd>, and we'll say</span> <kbd>while(have_posts)</kbd> <span>and then we have to just add the <kbd>_post</kbd>. Then we'll do the <kbd>endwhile</kbd> on the bottom of this div. So we'll say <kbd>php endwhile</kbd>. Now inside the <kbd>div</kbd> tag, we'll have an <kbd>h3</kbd> and that's going to be the title. So we can say <kbd>php the_title</kbd>. We're also going to have the thumbnail, so let's do <kbd>php</kbd> and check for the thumbnail first. We'll say <kbd>if(has_post_thumbnail)</kbd>. If there's a thumbnail, then we'll say <kbd>php the_post_thumbnail</kbd>. Then, we'll go right under the <kbd>endif</kbd> and we need our button, so it's going to actually be a link formatted as a button. We'll give is a class of button, and then this is going to go to <kbd>php echo the_permalink</kbd>. The text will just say <kbd>Details</kbd>. So let's save that and let's take a look:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="330" width="631" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537 image-border" src="images/fb4c461c-6d85-496c-a310-108d37d157cc.png" /></div>
<p><span>The reason we don't see anything here except for <span class="packt_screen">Hello world</span> is that's the only post we have. So we'll go in and create some posts. Let us just log back in real quick. We'll go to <span class="packt_screen">All Posts</span> and you can see we only have <span class="packt_screen">Hello world</span>. So let's go ahead and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add New</span>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="577" width="972" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1538 image-border" src="images/2cd376b1-07c0-4adc-bf4a-59ae3fafbaf1.png" /></div>
<p><span>Now notice that there's no area for the featured image down here, so we'll have to make changes in <kbd>functions.php</kbd> file:</span></p>
<pre>function ms_theme_setup(){<br/>    add_theme_support('custom-logo');<br/> <br/>    // Featured Image Support<br/>    <strong>add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');</strong><br/> <br/>    // Nav Menus<br/>    register_nav_menus(array(<br/>        'primary' =&gt; __('Primary Menu')<br/>    ));<br/>}</pre>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span>To add that, let's go to <kbd>functions.php</kbd> and go into the <kbd>ms_theme_setup</kbd> function. We'll type in <kbd>add_theme_support</kbd>, and we want <kbd>post-thumbnails</kbd>. Let us now check the output.<br/></span></div>
<p><span>You can now see the <span class="packt_screen">Featured Image</span> box at the bottom-right. So let's go ahead and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Featured Image</span> box and upload a file.</span></p>
<p><span>We have all these shirts. We'll choose the blue and white one and set that as a featured image. Let's call this <kbd>Blue &amp; White Shirt</kbd>. For the description, we'll get some sample text real quick:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="653" width="971" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1541 image-border" src="images/190878db-44b7-4d24-ae31-ce951e66be90.png" /></div>
<p><span>We'll copy a couple of random sentences for the description and paste that in. We want the price as well. So we'll put that in an <kbd>h3</kbd> and say <kbd>$9.99</kbd>. We also want the button, so we'll give that a class of <kbd>button</kbd> and we'll just say <kbd>Buy Now</kbd>. It's not going to have actual e-commerce functionality. So this is what pretty much all of our product descriptions are going to look like. Let's copy that, and then let's choose the <span class="packt_screen">Shirts</span> category. We can add some tags; we'll say <kbd>blue shirt</kbd>, <kbd>white shirt</kbd>, and <kbd>clothes</kbd>. We added those and that looks good, so let's go ahead and publish.</span></p>
<p><span>We'll go back to the home page and there's our shirt. We'll disable the <span class="packt_screen">Hello world</span> post in the <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span></span> by moving it to <span><span class="packt_screen">Trash</span></span>. <span>For the black shirt, we'll go ahead an upload the image. We'll grab the</span> <kbd>shirt_black.jpg</kbd> image file<span>, say <kbd>Black Shirt</kbd>, and then paste in what we had for the other one:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="653" width="971" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1542 image-border" src="images/4bead5fc-f147-4477-b955-364bb925f77d.png" /></div>
<p><span>We'll publish that and go ahead and add the rest of them. We went ahead and added the rest of the products. Let's go to the frontend and reload, and there we go! It's starting to look like a real shopping cart:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="765" width="970" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1543 image-border" src="images/19815457-06ac-4676-bdb2-5d864895e146.png" /></div>
<p><span>Now if we go and click on one of the <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> buttons, it takes us to the correct place, to the right product, but this isn't how we want it to set up. We want to have the description and look like a real shopping cart page.</span></p>
<p><span>Another issue if we go to a regular page and not a post, like say the <span class="packt_screen">About</span> page, is that it's formatted the same way as the main post page. So we don't want that either. So in the next section, we'll take care of that and get these pages looking correctly.</span></p>
