<p>In this chapter, we worked on the project to create a WordPress theme for a photo gallery. We created the HTML and CSS for our home page. Next, we have implemented the animation using the built-in W3.CSS-animation.</p>
<p>After this, we have templated the HTML into a WordPress theme, created header and footer files separately, and included them in the <kbd>index.php</kbd> file. Next, we have worked on the main post area and added <kbd>if</kbd> and <kbd>while</kbd> loops for the different post formats. Then, we have worked on the content pages, both the regular and gallery post content. Once this was done, we worked on the categories widget. Last, we worked on the theme of the single page.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will build a Twitter Bootstrap WordPress theme.</p>
