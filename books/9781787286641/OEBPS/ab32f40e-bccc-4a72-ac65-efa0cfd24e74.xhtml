<p>Awesome!! In this chapter we saw how to build a Twitter Bootstrap WordPress theme. We dealt with widgets such as <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Recent Posts</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Recent Comments</span> to make them fit in with the Bootstrap theme.</p>
<p>We also worked on the posts loop and included the metadata for it. We saw how to get the navbar set up as well as our sidebar widgets. We also added a Search box and built the single pages. We also dealt with comment functionality â€“ the comments section and form. I hope you enjoyed this chapter.</p>
