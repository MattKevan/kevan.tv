<p>Hopefully, you enjoyed this chapter.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we started off by installing and setting up WordPress. We moved on to create and enable themes. We also created an HTML structure and body, and applied some base styling to it. We dealt with single posts, thumbnails, pages, and menus. Later, we saw how we could add images and links to the post. In the end, we saw how to create a widget location in the theme and how to add the comments functionality to the widgets.</p>
<p>We'll be using what you've learned in this project and applying it in the future projects. You'll also learn more as we go.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will see how to build a WordPress theme.</p>
