<p>In this chapter, we'll build a WordPress theme for a photo gallery. We'll use just the core WordPress post system, and we'll not need any kind of third-party photo gallery. The following image is what it's going to look like; it's called <em>PhotoGenik</em>. This is the theme we are going to work on:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/b3bcc05b-6c6f-4ef3-a0d4-1261eb244e19.png" /></div>
<p>As shown in the preceding screenshot, you can see on the home page we have some images. If we hover over them we get a nice effect, and if we click on one it brings us to the single image page where it has a little animation that comes in. It also gives us the title, description, and then we have some meta info as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/fd789a60-23f4-47d6-9b91-3782901e4cb2.png" /></div>
<p>On the left-hand side at the top in the preceding screenshot, we have the core categories module. When we click on that, and you can see it only shows the pictures from that category, and they have a nice fade-in effect. We also have the <span class="packt_screen">Search</span> bar on the right-hand side at the top. In the search box we can just type in, let's say one of the titles of the images, and search; that particular image will come up.</p>
<p>For this project, we are going to be using the W3.CSS framework (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp</a>), which is pretty similar to Bootstrap. It's really easy to work with, and it provides a lot of nice-looking elements that you can see on the W3.CSS page. The animations that we have is actually coming from this framework, and there are some JavaScript widgets that we'll get into.</p>
<p>In the backend (refer to the following screenshot), if we look at our <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span>, you can see we have each photo has its own post:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/7c512409-9d41-4f6d-9ed3-f0f3c59fa2ec.png" /></div>
<p>If we click on the post, we'll find what we're using is the featured image:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/bafa2fd4-e1b5-4663-aa50-d0dfb39ba5ae.png" /></div>
<p>So all we have to do is upload a feature image, give it a title, description, and choose the <span class="packt_screen">Gallery</span> format, and it'll show up:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/29986edd-17f6-447c-ab3e-48aed90e5c4f.png" /></div>
<p>In our case, we'll have a custom gallery post format, and you can also use the standard format for just regular posts as well.</p>
<p>That's what we'll be doing. Let's go ahead and get started.</p>
