<p>In this chapter, we'll build an e-commerce theme or an online shop theme. We'll not have full functionality to buy products, but just the theme, and we'll look at how to format it so that the posts look more like product pages.</p>
<p>The following screenshot is of the home page we'll create. We have a header (<span class="packt_screen">MyShop</span>), a spot for a custom image (this is going to be available through the theme customizer, so you can upload that), our menu over the top-right corner of the page, a showcase widget (which is the big rectangular space right below the header, <span class="packt_screen">MyShop</span> with a headingâ€”Discount Clothing, some texts, and <span class="packt_screen">Read more</span>), and we'll see where we can actually edit that content. If we <span>scroll down the page (below the showcase widget rectangle) we have the main post loop, but we have it formatted so that it looks more like an e-commerce site.</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, we have some side widgets which is to right-hand side of the page:</span></p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="515" width="725" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1574 image-border" src="images/2fa74405-e1ec-4045-b6fc-14ac8bebb317.png" /></div>
<p>Now, if we click on <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> for one of the products, for example, <span class="packt_screen">Black Shirt</span>, it's going to take us to the product page (as shown in the following screenshot). It has the image, title, text, price, and then a <span class="packt_screen">Buy Now</span> button. Also, we have the tags below the <span class="packt_screen">Buy Now</span> button as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="216" width="545" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1592 image-border" src="images/901e6715-c845-4b2c-b624-140f1f80ffeb.png" /></div>
<p>Also, if we go to <span class="packt_screen">Blue &amp; White Shirt</span> we can see we have some images, so we can include an image gallery as well, and we will see how to do that:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="407" width="560" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1587 image-border" src="images/32aa4ada-0df3-4dea-aaaf-acd5fd3860f9.png" /></div>
<p>The pages themselves are very simple. We just have an <span class="packt_screen">About</span> page with a title and heading, and it's the same with <span class="packt_screen">Sample Page</span>. If we go to the backend of the page and go to <span class="packt_screen">Posts</span>, we can see the different products we have. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Pink Shirt</span> product; we have included the text, the price, and the button. If we scroll down, on the bottom-right corner we can see we're using the featured image.</p>
<p>For the showcase, if we go to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Widgets</span>, we can see in <span class="packt_screen">Showcase</span> we have a <span class="packt_screen">Showcase widget</span>, which is actually a custom widget that we'll create and use it in the theme. We also have our <span class="packt_screen">Sidebar</span> at the right-hand side of the page with the <span class="packt_screen">Categories</span> and then the <span class="packt_screen">Text widget</span>. Now for the gallery, if we go to the <span class="packt_screen">Blue Shirt</span> product and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Media,</span> we can go to <span class="packt_screen">Create Gallery</span> and choose a bunch of images, go ahead, and upload that gallery. If we click on <span class="packt_screen">Visual</span>, you can see that and we can edit it as a whole by clicking on the Edit icon as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="486" width="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1588 image-border" src="images/0a868f3f-1818-4dc8-a0c6-68cd62055f8e.png" /></div>
<p>That's pretty simple. It's not the best looking online shop you've ever seen, but it does have some features that are really important. For the logo, what we can do to switch that is go to <span class="packt_screen">Appearance</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Customize</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Site Identity</span> and then you will see the <span class="packt_screen">Logo</span> option from where we can remove it. We can also change it and update our title and tagline.</p>
