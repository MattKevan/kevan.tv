<p>Great! So that was pretty much it. The purpose of this project wasn't to build a beautiful theme, it was to really get you familiar with the different files that we need to create the syntax, the different functions, and things like that.</p>
<p>We saw different post formats and created design using HTML and CSS. We created a WordPress theme by learning how to display blog posts, single posts, custom archive pages, and different post formats. We also saw how to add an image to the post and dealt with pages, custom templates, and sub navigation. We also worked around theme widgets, custom homepages, and the comment functionality.</p>
<p>So, hopefully you enjoyed this chapter.</p>
<p>In our next chapter, we will build a WordPress theme for the photo gallery.</p>
