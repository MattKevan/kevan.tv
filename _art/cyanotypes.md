Cyanography is one of the earliest photographic print processes, invented in 1842 by Sir John Herschel. It was used later that same year by Anna Atkins to create the first book illustrated with photographs.

Commonly used to reproduce drawings and plans – hence the term 'blueprint' - cyanography can also be used to create expressive and unexpected images due to its low resolution and lack of tonal control. 

I created these images from photographs I'd taken by painting the light-sensitive emulsion on watercolour paper, applying a full-size acetate negative and exposing with ultraviolet light. After washing and drying, these were the results.
