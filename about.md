# About

I love the challenge of understanding a problem and discovering new ways to solve it, to make something function better, faster or more efficiently – whether it's a print publication, a website, a process or an organisation.

I'm currently the senior UX designer at Mumsnet, where I work closely with the design, editorial and tech teams to develop new services and improve the site's usability, with the overall aim of making parent's lives easier. Having recently become a dad, I fully understand just how vital that goal is.

Before joining Mumsnet, I was creative manager and UX lead for NDP, a Drupal-focused web agency. There, I was responsible for the studio's creative output, managing the creative team and working closely with the rest of the studio, including consultants, project managers and developers. I had the privilege to work with a wide range of clients, including Jesuits in Britain, Warchild, Children in Crisis, Scott's Miracle Gro, Breast Cancer Care and Make-A-Wish UK.

Although I now focus on UX design, I enjoy getting involved at all stages of the design process, from pitching to new clients, helping existing clients define their strategy, conducting user research, running workshops, producing personas, wireframes, content audits, prototypes, UML, finished designs and more. I'm also an experienced site builder and front-end developer – I've been building sites with Drupal and Wordpress for over eight years – so I also design and build sites myself too when time allows.

To get in touch send me an email at hello@kevan.tv – I'd love to hear from you.
