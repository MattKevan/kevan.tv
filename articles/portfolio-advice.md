### Include your portfolio

Always include your portfolio. Doesn't matter whether it's a website, a PDF or even a physical folder. Always include it. 

If you have a web portfolio, check it's working. And check again. Then test the link you've given to make sure it works. Then test it again.

For a recent vacancy, over half of applicants didn't include their portfolio, or their website didn't work, or the link was broken. We'd specifically asked for a portfolio, so anyone without one was disqualified.

**Side tip:** When designing your CV, don't increase your web address' letter spacing or add spaces between the characters as it breaks the link. Or if you do, test it first.

At least four applicants did this, meaning we couldn't see their portfolio. I spent a few minutes fixing one applicant's (quite long) URL, only to find their website was broken. Not a good first impression.

### Show your thinking


### Don't redesign existing apps

If you're at the start of your career or don't live work to showcase, including your own projects or coursework is absolutely fine. The purpose of a UX portfolio is to show your thinking and your approach to solving problems. The end result is important too, but as with most things UX, the process is more important than the destination.

I would recommend not, however, including redesign projects. I've seen a lot of people attempt to redesign the Netflix or Apple homepages, for example. The problem with these is that a quick portfolio project will rarely result in an improvement and they're completely divorced from the actual challenges, whether technical, buisness or user, faced by the actual design and development teams.

Instead, pick a problem that you or people close to you have and solve that.

That way you already know the problem inside-out and have likely thought about ways to solve it. And the result will be better because it's solving a problem that's personal to you, one you care about. That's interesting and fun and a much better way to show your personality and approach.
