### Include your portfolio

Always include your portfolio. Doesn't matter whether it's a website, a PDF or even a physical folder. Always include it. 

If you have a web portfolio, check it's working. And check again. Then test the link you've given to make sure it works. Then test it again.

Over half of applicants didn't include a link to their portfolio, or their website didn't work, or the link was broken in their CV. We'd specifically asked to see a portfolio in the job listing, so anyone without one was immediately disqualified.

**Side tip:** Don't increase the letter spacing in your web address when designing your CV. Sounds weird, but at least four CVs did this. It might look nicer, but PDFs interpret this as adding a space character between each letter, horribly breaking the link. 

I spent a good few minutes removing the spaces from one applicant's (quite long) URL, only to find their website was broken. Not the best first impression.
