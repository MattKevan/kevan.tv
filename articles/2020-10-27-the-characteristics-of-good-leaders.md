Leadership can be a somewhat vague concept, so and this list outlines the main attributes of a good leader, and provides a point of reference to work towards.

It's useful to compare your own behaviours and characteristics against this list as a way of uncovering which areas you need to work on, whether through self-assessment or by asking colleagues, team members and managers. What should you start, stop or continue?

#### **Leading yourself**

* **Acting with integrity** – Being professional and acting in the interests of all those involved.
* **Being honest and consistent** – Being, and being seen to be, fair
* **Being decisive** – Being prepared to take tough decisions and risks, as appropriate
* **Resolving complex problems** – Being creative in solving problems

#### Leading and developing others

* **Enabling** - Empowering people in a way that motivates and develops them
* **Inspiring others** – Being able to inspire others and to motivate them to achieve goals.
* **Being accessible** – Being approachable and not ‘status-conscious’ and making time to discuss people’s problems.
* **Encouraging change** – Being supportive to others in questioning traditional approaches and finding new ways to solve problems.

#### Leading the organisation

* **Networking and achieving** – Building and maintaining useful networks and achieving goals set.
* **Supporting a developmental culture** – Being supportive when mistakes are made, encouraging critical feedback about self and standards. 
* **Focusing effort** – Being team oriented in problem-solving and decision-making
