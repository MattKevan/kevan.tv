### 1. No surprises

The whole team - designers, developers, product managers, stakeholders and the wider organisation should have an understanding of both the problem that’s being solved and the approach taken to solve it. This requires carefully considered communication with all parties. Not everyone needs the same level of detail or frequency of communication, but if someone is surprised by what is proposed or what has been released, a communication failure has occured somewhere. 

Consider creating a [stakeholder power/interest grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis) and communications plan when starting projects to understand your stakeholders and decide how best and how often to communicate with them.

Never assume everyone understands the same thing. Every person involved will have a different understanding of your project's goals. This is especially true for people who are not deeply involved or if what they do only touches one aspect of your project, but can also apply to core team members and stakeholders. 

Restate the problem and the project's goals as often as you possibly can - at the start of every meeting, in every email and much more besides. Consider even creating a shared vocabulary with the team so that you can be more confident that when a term is used everyone understands roughly the same thing.

### 2. No deliverables

Often UX is focused around creating deliverables – a journey map, personas, polished UI designs etc.

### 3. No handovers

We don’t work in isolation, handing over our work at the last minute. Instead, we collaborate early and closely with developers as a single team to understand the problem, scope possible approaches and work to a shared solution.

### 4. No signoffs

While we may need approval for legal or compliance issues, we don’t need signoff before going live. Stakeholders should be well aware of the project and have had ample opportunity to contribute earlier in the process. And we should be confident in the quality and fitness-for-purpose of what we have created.

### 5. No last-minute changes

Last-minute changes mean that something has gone wrong in the project somewhere. It could be a communications failure in that someone wasn’t fully aware of the implications of a decision, or maybe the problem statement wasn’t properly explored at the beginning. It’s better to go back to the start and rethink things than release a broken or compromised product.

### 6. Don’t overthink it

It’s easy to get stuck in discovery, feeling like we have to know as much as possible before getting started. Instead, begin with the knowledge we have currently, iterate rapidly and learn through doing.

### 7. Cut scope not quality

Focus on delivering the minimum necessary to the highest quality. It’s better to deliver an incomplete but polished product than one that’s feature-complete but poorly executed. The rest of the features can be added later if they’re really necessary.

### 8. Move fast and fix things

We’re all acountable for the quality of our products. If we find a problem, it’s our responsibility to stop what we’re doing, raise an issue and fix or help fix the root cause before continuing. The earlier a problem is addressed, the easier it is to sort out.
